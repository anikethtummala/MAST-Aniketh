The total cost of the potato fries is 10 packs \u00d7 $0.30 = $3. The total cost of the fruit drinks is 5 cans, which I will estimate at $1 each, totaling $5.

The difference will give me the change Carly receives.\\n\\nAnswer:\\nCarly orders five hamburgers for $20 (5 * $4), ten packs of potato fries for $3 ($0.30 * 10), and assuming the fruit drinks are $1 each, five cans would cost $5 (5 * $1), bringing the total to $20 + $3 + $5 = $28.

Because we can't find a specific numerical answer without the cost of the fruit drinks, the conclusion reflects that there is an unknown variable in the final answer. \\n\\nIf we assume a reasonable estimate for each fruit drink (e.g., $1 each), that would give:\\nx = 5 drinks x $1 = $5 \\nTotal cost would then be $28, leading to change of $22.
