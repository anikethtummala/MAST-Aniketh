# AG2 Trajectories

- Application scenario [A1: Math Problem Solving](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155) mentioned in the original paper. 
- Unfortunately, not enough trajs. So needed to generate some trajs with the [code adapted](experiments/ag2_math_chat.py) from the [original one](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_MathChat.ipynb) from the AG2 Respository. 
- [GSM-Plus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19255) is used. 
- Trajs with potential failures are then copied in this folder for human checks.
