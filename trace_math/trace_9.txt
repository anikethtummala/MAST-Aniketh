To do this, we need to divide favorable outcomes (fulfilling all conditions including the last two being blue) by the total outcomes satisfying the initial conditions.\n\n6. **Favorable Outcomes**:\n   - For the last two marbles to be blue, among the initial sequence of removals satisfying the given conditions, both reds would need to be removed earlier without affecting the last two blues.\n\n7. **Total Outcomes**:\n   - We first determine how many setups align with having a blue marble third and a red marble first, considering sequential removal.\n\nLet's run some computations to ascertain counts of these sequences. Crucially, each sequence arrangement that obeys our condition will pair with multiple outcomes.\n\n**We'll have the computation agent find the number of valid sequences for us**:\n\n- Total sequence of draws satisfying our constraint.\n- Sequence rearrangements resulting in the final two marbles being blue.\n\nLet's proceed with these computations.",
