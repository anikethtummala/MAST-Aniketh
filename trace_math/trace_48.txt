        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the constraints and possible configurations of planes that pass through the points in \\( S \\) without passing through the origin.\n\nThe set \\( S \\) includes all points \\((x, y, z)\\) where \\( x, y, z \\) are integers in the range \\([0, n]\\) and \\( x + y + z > 0 \\). The total number of such points is \\((n+1)^3 - 1\\).\n\nNow, for a plane not to pass through the origin, it must be of the form \\( ax + by + cz = d \\), where \\( d \\neq 0 \\). We need to find configurations of planes such that all points in \\( S \\) lie on at least one of these planes.\n\n### Symmetrical Consideration and Primary Idea:\nUsing symmetry and the structure of the problem, we consider planes of the form \\( x + y + z = k \\), where the smallest value of \\( k \\) is 1 because we cannot include the origin.\n\n1. **Plane Structures**: A plane of the form \\( x + y + z = k \\) includes points that sum to \\( k \\), where \\( 1 \\leq k \\leq 3n \\).\n\n2. **Constraints**: The possible values of \\( k \\) depend on the non-zero values and the bounds of \\( x\\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\), so we would need configurations involving these bounds.\n\n3. **Point Coverage**: For each value of \\( k \\), a plane \\( x + y + z = k \\) will only cover points satisfying the equation for that specific \\( k \\).\n\n### Calculation of Number of Planes:\nSince it is essential to cover all combinations without touching the origin, while ensuring all points from \\( S \\) are covered, we can try systematic solving:\n\n- **Range of \\( k \\)**: Notice that:\n  \\[\n  0 < x+y+z \\leq 3n\n  \\]\n- **Candidate planes**: Therefore planes \\( x+y+z = 1, x+y+z = 2, \\ldots, x+y+z = 3n \\).\n\n### Counting All Points:\nFor each plane \\( x+y+z = 1, x+y+z = 2, \\ldots, x+y+z = 3n \\), there are specific patterns:\n- **1 Plane per value of \\( k \\)**: Each \\( k \\) between 1 and 3n corresponds to a unique plane potentially covering specific point arrangements for elemental sum as \\( k \\).\n\n### Minimal Number Realization:\nExamine whether it's possible with fewer distinct forms other than direct elemental summations:\n\n- **Use diverse types** \\( ax+by+cz = k \\) with different coefficients, possibly allowing reducing needed groups, bearing non-redundancy for overlapping values or practical considerations.\n\nMaking a note of practicality, the minimal plane set has solutions each embedding specific K-contribution shifts. Algorithmically defining extensions or sums per inline considerations is further refined than elemental directional coverage like singular summed planes beyond the grid limited by boundary alignment.\n\nThis suffices verification on whether single partition planes per unit towards quad-fit caters directly with individual \\( n \\)-sum minus recombined in system setup to not exceed base calculation.\n\nThus finalizing computation:\n\\[\nx + y + z = 1, 2, ..., n\n\\]\n\nwhich constitutes a straightforward coverage spread across \\( S \\).\n\nVERIFICATION",

By starting from \\( k = 1 \\), we ensure no plane passes through the origin.\n\n3. **Completeness**:\n   - Consider the sum \\( x+y+z \\) can range from 1 to \\( 3n \\). Hence, these planes collectively span every possible combination of points not in juxtaposition to enter the domain's boundaries without omitting.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The smallest number of planes to cover all points of \\( S \\) is indeed \\( 3n \\), each corresponding uniquely to a specific sum \\( k = x+y+z \\).\n\nFINAL ANSWER: \\(3n\\)",
