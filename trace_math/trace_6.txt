This means that each row has all integers from 1 to 100 appearing exactly once.\n\n2. **Difference Constraint:** For any two distinct rows \\( r \\) and \\( s \\), there must exist at least one column \\( c \\) where the entries differ by at least 2.\n\n### Strategy:\n\nA possible approach to solve this would be to explore systematic ways to construct such a matrix \\( T \\) or find upper and lower bounds for the number of such rows \\( N \\). Here are some steps to consider:\n\n1. **Lower Bound Construction:**\n   - Start by examining small examples. Construct rows such that the permutations of numbers 1 to 100 differ sufficiently in some column.\n   - Attempt to construct rows in a specific pattern that obeys the permutation order yet maintains the difference constraint.\n  \n2. **Upper Bound Determination:**\n   - Consider analyzing the possibilities of having two rows that fail the difference condition. Finding a column with same numbers (or numbers differing by 1) reduces potential rows.\n\n3. **Direct Construction & Contradiction:**\n   - For experimental trials, check constructions incrementally for contradictions involving difference constraints across multiple columns and attempt to maximize \\( N \\).\n\nConsidering the columns offer constraints for differentiating rows:\n\n- Let's explore the theoretical upper limit of such arrangements before attempting constructions.\n- We know that for \\( N = 101 \\) rows, even one pair failing the condition concludes the impossibility due to the imposed condition.\n\n### Key Step:\n\nGiven that each pair shares a difference in at least one column:\n- For matrix operation, consider consecutive constraints across discrete arrangements or complementary permutations for differences each step.\n\nWe can start by requesting the computation agent to verify this idea:\n\nFind explicit arrangements of smaller subsets and consider extending them systematically. Constructively, initially challenge the approach with smaller \\( N \\) and attempt to generalize patterns for extensions or contradictions past \\( N = 50 \\).\n\nUltimately, this leads to precise enumeration or calculated bindings.\n\nLet's request computational assistance for specific trials or potential contradictions at levels \\( N = 50 \\) through \\( N = 95\\):\n\n1. Test permutations for adherence to property conditions in varied columns.\n2. Seek suitable arrangements and derive any infeasibility or indications of limitations in \\( N \\).\n\nThen we can fine-tune based on derived properties or faced contradiction till evaluated exhaustive arrangements:\n\n```python\n# Please compute valid distinct rows with certain established permutation patterns,\n# including upper bound tests or direct construction:\n#\n# Experiment with deriving properties such as:\n# - Exemplifying permutations of possible maximal rows from selected columns.\n# - Verifying if incremental constructs exceed threshold conditions systematically in computation.\n```\nFinally, let's proceed with more structured verification for each attempt relevant to computed outcomes.",
