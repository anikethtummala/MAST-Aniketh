        "content": "To determine the largest such \\( N \\), we need to take into account both the permutations of the numbers 1 to 100 in each row and the condition that demands distinctiveness between rows.\n\nFirstly, let's recap the conditions:\n1. Every row must be a permutation of the integers 1 to 100.\n2. For any two rows, say \\( r \\) and \\( s \\), there must exist at least one column \\( c \\) such that \\( |T(r, c) - T(s, c)| \\geq 2 \\).\n\nThis problem is essentially about finding the maximum number of such permutations that satisfy the non-collision condition, reflected by the absolute difference of at least 2 in at least one column for any pair of rows.\n\nThe absolute difference condition \\( |T(r, c) - T(s, c)| \\geq 2 \\) ensures that entries in identical positions from different rows aren't part of any consecutive numbers like \\((1, 2)\\), \\((2, 3)\\),... or similar consecutive numbers, systematically prohibiting aligning numbers that are very close together in any column.\n\n### Plan and Analysis:\nLet's consider how permutations could be structured:\n\n1. **Distinctiveness of Row Permutations**: The challenge lies in ensuring permutations such that no pair of permutations (or rows) merely differ by consecutive number swaps.\n  \n2. **Constructing Permutations**: \n   - Determine the structure of permutations that are far apart in terms of column comparisons.\n   \n3. **Column Evaluation Strategy**: \n   - Consider splitting numbers and designating criteria to form distinct rows.\n   - If permutations differ too closely, design the row placements or shifts to create a situation where they cannot be closely aligned.\n  \nNext, the task requires evaluating potential values of \\( N \\). Given \\( 100! \\) permutations exist, the limitation stems from aligning them such that rows aren't too similar at any column \\(c\\).\n\n### Sufficient Condition:\nOne conventional setup for permutation problems theorizes:\n- **Latin Square Conditions**: The problem hints towards a condition reminiscent of ensuring orthogonality in squares, primarily to avoid certain alignments.\n\n### Approach:\n1. **Achievable N Estimate**: \n   Start from smaller \\( N \\), incrementing:\n   - Each row must increasingly contrast distinctly when aligned column-wise with differently permuted rows.\n  \n2. **Constructive Verification**:\n   - Prove possible distinct permutation setups for maximal \\( N \\).\n  \n3. **Observe Non-triviality**:\n   - Verification through construction proofs or proof by realization understanding covers feasible \\( N \\).\n\nTherefore, it's crucial to assess the configurations to derive a maximal \\( N \\) iteratively. There are deep combinatorial roots suggesting more sophisticated arrangements leading up to the maximal solution.\n\nFinally, let's simulate or reasonably calculate what's feasible very close to 100 depending on restriction efficacy:\n\n### Computation Request:\nTo further solidify, let's compute an estimate of such permutations to achieve maximal targeted \\( N \\). We shall later verify or transit through computed numbers.",

For an array with \\( n \\) as the side length, there can be at most \\( n - 1 \\) permutations where this distinctiveness property holds for 3 or more values difference.
