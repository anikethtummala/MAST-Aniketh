The potential minimum step increment would be 1 for a predictable progression.\n\nTo see a complete range without gaps, understand that:\n\n- Each increment \\( n \\mapsto n+1 \\) typically results in at least \\( s(n) \\) incrementing by 1, except when there's a carry which can make it increment by 2 briefly, but the next number removes the gap.\n\nVerify this by checking across cases with different numbers of digits \"rolling over\" (carry). It ensures, however big jumps are temporary/offset so \\( s(n) \\) covers every integer without permanent gaps up to its peak.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIdentifying the starting and ending points \\( s(n) = 0 \\) to \\( s(n) = 10035 \\), which form a complete chain without gaps for every integer within this full range.\n\nThere are \\( 10035 - 0 + 1 = 10036 \\) numbers, ensuring completeness without skips - all values (inclusively uninterrupted) from 0 through 10035 are obtained.\n\nThus, \\( |\\{ s(0), s(1), \\ldots, s(9999) \\}| = 10036 \\).",
