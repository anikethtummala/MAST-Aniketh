        "content": "To find the probability that when Victor stops removing balls there are at least 1 red ball and at least 1 green ball on the table, we need to consider the different ways he can remove balls and when he will stop. \n\nFirstly, stopping occurs when two balls of the same color appear. Thus, Victor will definitely have two balls on the table that are of the same color. The possible scenarios when he stops are:\n1. Two green balls and any number of red balls.\n2. Two red balls and any number of green balls.\n\nHowever, we want to ensure there is at least one ball of each color on the table when he stops. Therefore, the cases we care about are:\n\n- **Case 1:** Victor removes a green ball, then a red ball, before finally adding one more green ball. This results in one red and two green on the table when he stops.\n- **Case 2:** Victor removes a red ball, then a green ball, before finally adding one more red ball. This results in two red balls and one green ball on the table when he stops.\n\nLet's calculate this probability considering the cases mentioned:\n\n1. **Sequence for Case 1 (GRG):**\n   - First ball is green\n   - Second ball is red\n   - Third ball is green\n\n2. **Sequence for Case 2 (RGR):**\n   - First ball is red\n   - Second ball is green\n   - Third ball is red\n\nSince the events are sequential and removal is without replacement, the exact orders matter per the sequences (GRG and RGR).\n\nWe need to first compute the probabilities of each sequence and then sum them to find the overall probability of interest.\n\nLet's proceed with the computation agent to compute individual sequence probabilities.",
