MAS FINAL ANSWER: \(\frac{27}{64}\)
TRUE FINAL ANSWER: $\frac{27}{64}$

TRUE SOLUTION: If Oi-Lam tosses 3 heads, then George has no coins to toss, so cannot toss exactly 1 head. If Oi-Lam tosses 2, 1 or 0 heads, then George has at least one coin to toss, so can toss exactly 1 head.

Therefore, the following possibilities exist:

* Oi-Lam tosses 2 heads out of 3 coins and George tosses 1 head out of 1 coin
* Oi-Lam tosses 1 head out of 3 coins and George tosses 1 head out of 2 coins
* Oi-Lam tosses 0 heads out of 3 coins and George tosses 1 head out of 3 coins

We calculate the various probabilities.

If 3 coins are tossed, there are 8 equally likely possibilities: $\mathrm{HHH}, \mathrm{HHT}, \mathrm{HTH}, \mathrm{THH}, \mathrm{TTH}$, THT, HTT, TTT. Each of these possibilities has probability $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{3}=\frac{1}{8}$. Therefore,



* the probability of tossing 0 heads out of 3 coins is $\frac{1}{8}$
* the probability of tossing 1 head out of 3 coins is $\frac{3}{8}$
* the probability of tossing 2 heads out of 3 coins is $\frac{3}{8}$
* the probability of tossing 3 heads out of 3 coins is $\frac{1}{8}$

If 2 coins are tossed, there are 4 equally likely possibilities: HH, HT, TH, TT. Each of these possibilities has probability $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}=\frac{1}{4}$. Therefore, the probability of tossing 1 head out of 2 coins is $\frac{2}{4}=\frac{1}{2}$.

If 1 coin is tossed, the probability of tossing 1 head is $\frac{1}{2}$.

To summarize, the possibilities are

* Oi-Lam tosses 2 heads out of 3 coins (with probability $\frac{3}{8}$ ) and George tosses 1 head out of 1 coin (with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ )
* Oi-Lam tosses 1 head out of 3 coins (with probability $\frac{3}{8}$ ) and George tosses 1 head out of 2 coins (with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ )
* Oi-Lam tosses 0 heads out of 3 coins (with probability $\frac{1}{8}$ ) and George tosses 1 head out of 3 coins (with probability $\frac{3}{8}$ )

Therefore, the overall probability is $\frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{2}+\frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{3}{8}=\frac{27}{64}$.
