The second equation \\( x^3 + Bx^2 + 50 = 0 \\) also shares two of these roots. We will assume without loss of generality that the common roots are \\( r \\) and \\( s \\).\n\nThe task is to find the product \\( rs \\) of the common roots.\n\n### Steps to solve the problem:\n1. **Find relations using Vieta\u2019s formulas for the first equation:**\n    - Sum of roots: \\( r + s + t = 0 \\)\n    - Sum of products of roots taken two at a time: \\( rs + rt + st = A \\)\n    - Product of the roots: \\( rst = -10 \\)\n\n2. **Establish the second equation with two common roots:**\n    - Assume the roots of the second cubic are \\( r, s, \\) and some third root \\( u \\).\n    - Using Vieta's formulas on the second equation:\n      - \\( r + s + u = -B \\)\n      - The sum of products of roots taken two at a time again is not uniquely given by Vieta here.\n      - Product of the roots: \\( rsu = -50 \\)\n\n3. **Relate the third roots of the equations:**\n    - From the product relation from the two equations, having identified the roots, we have:\n      - Via the first equation: \\( rst = -10 \\).\n      - Via the second equation: \\( rsu = -50 \\).\n\n4. **Determine \\( u \\) using the product relation:**\n    - By dividing these relationships, \\( \\frac{rsu}{rst} = \\frac{-50}{-10} \\rightarrow u = 5t \\).\n\n5. **Use the relation for sum of roots to eliminate \\( u \\) and find \\( rs \\):**\n    - Substitute \\( u = 5t \\) in the sum of roots for the second equation:\n      - \\( r + s + 5t = -B \\)\n    - Substitute \\( r + s = -t \\) from the first equation:\n      - \\( -t + 5t = -B \\rightarrow 4t = -B \\rightarrow t = -\\frac{B}{4} \\).\n\n6. **Determine \\( rs \\):**\n    - Use \\( rst = -10 \\):\n      - Substituting \\( t = -\\frac{B}{4} \\), we have:\n      - \\( rs(-\\frac{B}{4}) = -10 \\),\n      - This rearranges to:\n      - \\( rs = \\frac{40}{B} \\).\n\nThe product of the common roots is \\( rs = \\frac{40}{B} \\).
