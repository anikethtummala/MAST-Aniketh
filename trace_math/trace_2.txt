        "content": "To solve this problem, let's use the given geometric conditions and angle measurements to determine \\(\\angle C\\). We follow these steps:\n\n1. **Examining the configuration and notation**:\n   - Let \\(\\angle BAC = \\angle A = \\alpha\\).\n   - Let \\(\\angle ABC = \\angle B = \\beta\\).\n   - Let \\(\\angle ACB = \\angle C = \\gamma\\).\n   - We are given \\(\\alpha > \\beta > \\gamma\\).\n\n2. **Understand geometric conditions**:\n   - The altitude \\(AD\\) from \\(A\\) to \\(BC\\) makes an angle of \\(6^\\circ\\) with the angle bisector \\(AE\\).\n   - The altitude \\(BF\\) from \\(B\\) to \\(AC\\) makes an angle of \\(18^\\circ\\) with the angle bisector \\(BG\\).\n\n3. **Relating the given angles to the triangle's angles**:\n   - The angle between the altitude and the angle bisector at \\(A\\) is determined by \\(\\angle DAE = 6^\\circ\\). We know \\(\\angle BAD = 90^\\circ - \\angle C = 90^\\circ - \\gamma\\).\n   - Therefore, the actual angle bisector angle is \\(\\angle BAD - \\angle DAE = (90^\\circ - \\gamma) - 6^\\circ = 84^\\circ - \\gamma = (\\frac{\\alpha}{2})\\).\n   - Similarly, the angle between the altitude and the angle bisector at \\(B\\) is \\(18^\\circ\\). Here \\(\\angle ABC = \\beta\\), so \\(\\angle BFD = 90^\\circ - \\angle C = 90^\\circ - \\gamma\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(\\angle FBG = \\angle BFD - 18^\\circ\\), yielding \\(72^\\circ - \\gamma = \\frac{\\beta}{2}\\).\n\n4. **Set up the equations**:\n   - From \\(\\angle BAD\\), we obtain the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\alpha}{2} = 84^\\circ - \\gamma\n     \\]\n     Hence, \\(\\alpha = 2(84^\\circ - \\gamma) = 168^\\circ - 2\\gamma\\).\n   - From \\(\\angle FBG\\), we obtain the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\beta}{2} = 72^\\circ - \\gamma\n     \\]\n     Hence, \\(\\beta = 2(72^\\circ - \\gamma) = 144^\\circ - 2\\gamma\\).\n\n5. **Using \\(\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = 180^\\circ\\)**:\n   - Substitute \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) with their expressions:\n     \\[\n     (168^\\circ - 2\\gamma) + (144^\\circ - 2\\gamma) + \\gamma = 180^\\circ\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     312^\\circ - 3\\gamma = 180^\\circ\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     132^\\circ = 3\\gamma\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\gamma = 44^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n6. **Verify the ordering**:\n   - \\(\\alpha = 168^\\circ - 2 \\times 44^\\circ = 80^\\circ\\)\n   - \\(\\beta = 144^\\circ - 2 \\times 44^\\circ = 56^\\circ\\)\n   - Clearly, \\(80^\\circ > 56^\\circ > 44^\\circ\\), confirming \\(\\angle A > \\angle B > \\angle C\\).\n\nThus, the measure of angle \\(C\\) is \\(\\gamma = 44^\\circ\\).\n\nVERIFICATION",
