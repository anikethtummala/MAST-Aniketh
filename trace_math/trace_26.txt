It's impossible for both to be integers as \\( a_1 \\) can only be an integer greater than zero, while \\( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\) cannot be an integer unless \\( a_1 = 1 \\), leading to only one possibility instead of infinitely many.\n\n**Step 2**: Consider pairs:\n- For \\( n = 2 \\), let \\( a_1 = p/q \\) and \\( a_2 = r/s \\) be rational numbers in reduced form. Then:\n  - \\( S = \\frac{ps + rq}{qs} \\) must be an integer, demanding \\( ps + rq = kqs \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n  - \\( T = \\frac{q}{p} + \\frac{s}{r} = \\frac{qr + sp}{pr} \\). For this to be an integer, \\( qr + sp = lcpr \\) for some integer \\( l \\).\n\n**Step 3**: Consider general \\( n \\):\nFor general \\( n \\), we want a set-up such that:\n- One possible construction is to look at sequences where balances between numerators and denominators align to satisfy both integer conditions. For example, \\( a_i \\) being unit fractions (i.e., reciprocal values like \\( \\frac{1}{q_i} \\)) can provide symmetries that aid the summing reciprocals approach, explored for small values of \\( n \\).\n\n**Case \\( n = 3 \\)**:\n- Continuing with the idea above: use values like \\( a_i = 1/m_i \\) where \\( m_i \\) structured carefully can meet both conditions. Finding specific sequences from such \\( m_i \\) yielding variations in sums and reciprocal sums can achieve an infinite count of possibilities.\n\n**Conjecture Formulation**:\nProbe the number \\( n = 3 \\) specifically where juggling particular palindromes or systems (like \\( a_i = \\frac{p_i}{q_i} \\)) maintains integrity in both sum and reciprocal sum, focusing on the interplay of divisors and number theory properties.\n\nSuch explorations could validate or invalidate smaller \\( n \\) reductions, mostly invalidating \\( n = 1, 2 \\) through lack of combinatory latitude for infinitude. A proof or hypothesis counterexample confirms:\n\n\\( n = 3\\) appears achievable, leveraging integer weight spreads across triples where balancing acts find infinity in parametric design. Summing relational harmonics and investigating close packing combinatorics with rational floods the main cases.\n\nThus, pass this hypothesis for computation evidence, validating exploratory corroborations.",
