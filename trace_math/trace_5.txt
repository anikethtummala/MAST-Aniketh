The number of ways to choose 3 vertices out of 6 to form a triangle is calculated by the combination formula \\(\\binom{n}{r}\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of items to choose from, and \\(r\\) is the number of items to choose. Here, \\(n = 6\\) and \\(r = 3\\).\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of triangles**:\n   \\[\n   N = \\binom{6}{3}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we need to categorize these triangles and calculate their areas. In a regular hexagon with side length 1, there are different types of triangles:\n\n- **Equilateral triangles**: Triangles formed by selecting vertices with equal distance such that they form an equilateral triangle.\n- **Isosceles triangles**: Triangles where two sides are equal.\n- **Scalene triangles**: Triangles where all sides are of different lengths, though in this context with regular hexagon vertices, all will likely result in isosceles due to construction.\n\n2. **Determine the type of triangles**:\n   - **Equilateral triangles**: There is only 1 such triangle, formed by alternating vertices.\n   - **Other triangles**: Depending on selection, varying side lengths and angles may arise.\n\n3. **Calculate the area of specific triangle types**:\n   - **Equilateral triangle with side length 1**: Use the standard formula for an equilateral triangle's area.\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{equilateral}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times \\text{side}^2\n   \\]\n\n   - **Isosceles and other triangles**: We can use the general formula for the area of a triangle using vertex coordinates or by Heron's formula if side lengths are known.\n\nNext, I will request the computation agent to perform these calculations.\n   \n**Computation requirements**:\n- Compute the number of triangles \\( \\binom{6}{3} \\).\n- Compute the area of the equilateral triangle of side length 1.\n- Calculate the average area from the computed areas.\n\nOnce computed, we will analyze various types to consider differences and compute the final average of these triangle areas.
