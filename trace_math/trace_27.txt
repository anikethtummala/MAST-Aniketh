We will first determine some preliminary angles and leverage perpendicularity and cylic properties if they arise.\n\nI will request the computation agent to calculate or verify intermediary steps if needed. For now:\n\n1. Analyze or compute any necessary intermediary points related to \\( D, J, E, C_1 \\).\n2.
