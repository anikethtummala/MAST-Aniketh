From the equation \\((x-1)(y-2) = 0\\), we have two primary possibilities:\n   - \\(x = 1\\)\n   - \\(y = 2\\)\n\n2.

The third equation is \\(x + yz = 9\\).\n\nLet's explore the cases:\n\n**Case 1: \\(x = 1\\)**\n- If \\(x = 1\\), then from the third equation \\(1 + yz = 9\\), which simplifies to \\(yz = 8\\).\n- From \\((x-3)(z+2) = 0\\), since \\(x \\neq 3\\), we must have \\(z = -2\\).\n\n   Thus, \\(yz = y(-2) = 8 \\implies y = -4\\).\n\nThis leads us to the potential solution \\((x, y, z) = (1, -4, -2)\\).\n\n**Case 2: \\(y = 2\\)**\n- If \\(y = 2\\), then from the third equation \\(x + 2z = 9\\).\n- From \\((x-3)(z+2) = 0\\), we consider two sub-cases:\n   1. \\(x = 3\\)\n      - With \\(x = 3\\), from the third equation \\(3 + 2z = 9\\), which simplifies to \\(2z = 6\\). Hence, \\(z = 3\\).\n      - Therefore, for this sub-case, a potential solution is \\((x, y, z) = (3, 2, 3)\\).\n\n   2. \\(z = -2\\)\n      - If \\(z = -2\\), from the third equation \\(x + 2(-2) = 9 \\implies x - 4 = 9\\), which gives \\(x = 13\\).\n      - Therefore, for this sub-case, a potential solution is \\((x, y, z) = (13, 2, -2)\\).\n\n**Case 3: \\(x = 3\\)**\n- If \\(x = 3\\), the second equation's condition is satisfied automatically, i.e., \\(x = 3\\).\n- From \\((x-1)(y-2) = 0\\), since \\(x \\neq 1\\), we must have \\(y = 2\\).\n- For the third equation, with \\(x = 3\\) and \\(y = 2\\), it simplifies to \\(3 + 2z = 9\\).\n- Solving \\(3 + 2z = 9\\) gives us \\(2z = 6\\) or \\(z = 3\\).\n\nThis is again solution \\((x, y, z) = (3, 2, 3)\\), which we already found in Case 2.\n\nIn summary, we have found potential solutions: \\((1, -4, -2)\\), \\((3, 2, 3)\\), and \\((13, 2, -2)\\). \n\nNow, let's pass these candidate solutions for verification. \n\nVERIFICATION",
