Let's analyze this separately for \\( x \\geq 0 \\) and \\( x < 0 \\) due to the absolute value:\n\n2. **Case 1: \\( x \\geq 0 \\):**\n   \n   Here, \\( |x| = x \\), so the equation becomes:\n\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 4 = 2x + k\n   \\]\n\n   Rearranging gives:\n\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 2x - 4 - k = 0\n   \\]\n\n   For there to be no intersection for \\( x \\geq 0 \\), this quadratic must have no real roots in the non-negative domain. The discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) must be less than or equal to zero, or positive but ensuring roots aren't within the desired domain.\n\n3. **Compute the discriminant:**\n\n\\[\n   \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-2)^2 - 4(1)(-4-k) = 4 + 16 + 4k = 20 + 4k\n\\]\n\nFor no solutions, \\(\\Delta \\leq 0\\). Calculate the necessary condition for \\( k \\):\n\n\\[\n   20 + 4k \\leq 0 \\implies 4k \\leq -20 \\implies k \\leq -5\n\\]\n\nThis condition ensures no intersection from roots while maintaining Vertex (Axis symmetry, the lowest point of parabola for x>0) without touching the transformed line.\n\n4. **Case 2: \\( x < 0 \\):**\n\nWhen \\( x < 0 \\), \\( |x| = -x \\), the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n   x^2 - 4 = -2x + k\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives:\n\n\\[\n   x^2 + 2x - 4 - k = 0\n\\]\n\nThe discriminant here is the same test:\n\n\\[\n   \\Delta = 2^2 - 4(1)(-4-k) = 4 + 16 + 4k = 20 + 4k\n\\]\n\nThe condition remains \\( 20 + 4k \\leq 0 \\) yielding again:\n\n\\[\n   k \\leq -5\n\\]\n\nFor both conditions over \\( x \\geq 0 \\) and \\( x < 0 \\), the same inequality \\( k \\leq -5 \\) follows which ensures the parabola and the absolute line variation do not intersect anywhere over the real line.\n\n5. **Conclusion and Verification:**\n\nSince the condition \\( k \\leq -5 \\) required for both positive and negative \\( x \\) is same, provides coherence in non-intersecting behavior across domain symmetry.\n\nI will pass this solution for the verification step.\n\nVERIFICATION",
