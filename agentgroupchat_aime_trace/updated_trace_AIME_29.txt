C0003 say to All: ### Context Analysis:
We need to compute the product over all 13th roots of unity (including 1): ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 − 2ω^k + ω^{2k}), where ω is a 13th root of unity with ω ≠ 1. Since 13 is prime, ω has order 13, so {ω^k | k=0..12} are all 13th roots of unity. The product can be recognized as ∏_{ζ^13=1} (ζ^2 − 2ζ + 2), which equals the resultant Res(ζ^13 − 1, ζ^2 − 2ζ + 2). For monic polynomials, this equals ∏ over the roots β of ζ^2 − 2ζ + 2 of (β^13 − 1). The quadratic ζ^2 − 2ζ + 2 has roots β = 1 ± i. Thus the product is [(1+i)^{13} − 1][(1−i)^{13} − 1] = |(1+i)^{13} − 1|^2. Using (1+i)^{13} = −64 − 64i, we get (−64 − 64i) − 1 = −65 − 64i, whose modulus squared is 65^2 + 64^2 = 8321. The remainder modulo 1000 is 321.

### Key Information Summary:
- Product equals ∏_{ζ^13=1} (ζ^2 − 2ζ + 2) = ∏_{β∈{1±i}} (β^{13} − 1).
- (1+i)^{13} = −64 − 64i ⇒ (1+i)^{13} − 1 = −65 − 64i.
- Product = |−65 − 64i|^2 = 65^2 + 64^2 = 8321.
- Remainder modulo 1000: 321.

C0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:
Let f(z) = z^2 − 2z + 2 with roots r1 = 1 + i and r2 = 1 − i. For a 13th root of unity ω (primitive since ω ≠ 1 and 13 is prime), the set {ω^k | 0 ≤ k ≤ 12} is all 13th roots of unity. Use the identity:
∏_{k=0}^{12} f(ω^k) = ∏_{i=1}^2 (r_i^{13} − 1),
since ∏_{k=0}^{12} (r − ω^k) = r^{13} − 1 and deg f = 2 gives no sign change.

Compute (1 + i)^{13}:
(1 + i)^2 = 2i, (1 + i)^4 = −4, (1 + i)^8 = 16,
so (1 + i)^{13} = (1 + i)^{8+4+1} = 16 · (−4) · (1 + i) = −64(1 + i) = −64 − 64i.
Thus (1 + i)^{13} − 1 = −65 − 64i, and its conjugate gives (1 − i)^{13} − 1 = −65 + 64i.

Therefore the product is
(−65 − 64i)(−65 + 64i) = 65^2 + 64^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.
The k = 0 term equals f(1) = 1, consistent with the above.

Remainder modulo 1000: 8321 mod 1000 = 321.

### Proof Structure:
1. Define f(z) = z^2 − 2z + 2 with roots 1 ± i.
2. Use ∏_{k=0}^{12} (r − ω^k) = r^{13} − 1 to get ∏_{k=0}^{12} f(ω^k) = ∏_{i=1}^2 (r_i^{13} − 1).
3. Compute (1 + i)^{13} = −64 − 64i, hence factors are −65 ∓ 64i.
4. Multiply conjugates to obtain 65^2 + 64^2 = 8321.
5. Conclude remainder modulo 1000 is 321.

C0004 say to All: ### Calculations: Let f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)). For 13th roots of unity ζ with ζ^13 = 1, the product ∏_{k=0}^{12} f(ζ) equals ∏_{ζ} (ζ - (1+i)) ∏_{ζ} (ζ - (1-i)) = (1 - (1+i)^{13})(1 - (1-i)^{13}). Compute (1+i)^{13} = -64(1+i) = -64 - 64i and (1-i)^{13} = -64(1-i) = -64 + 64i. Thus the product is (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i) = 65^2 + 64^2 = 8321. Remainder modulo 1000: 8321 mod 1000 = 321.

C0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: No prior solutions were provided to analyze. Key potential pitfalls checked:
- Ensured ω is primitive since 13 is prime, so {ω^k} runs over all 13 roots including 1.
- Correctly used the resultant identity: ∏_{r: r^13=1} f(r) = ∏_{f(s)=0} (s^13 - 1) for monic polynomials.
- Computed (1±i)^{13} accurately using polar form, and verified arithmetic.

### Corrections: Compute P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) = ∏_{x^{13}=1} (x^2 - 2x + 2).
Let f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2; its roots are 1 ± i. Then
P = ((1+i)^{13} - 1)((1-i)^{13} - 1).
(1+i)^{13} = -64(1+i), so the factors are -65 ∓ 64i, whose product is 65^2 + 64^2 = 8321.
Remainder modulo 1000 is 321.

C0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: 
Let p(t) = 2t^2 - 2t + 1. The desired product is ∏_{k=0}^{12} p(ω^k), where ω is a primitive 13th root of unity. This equals the resultant Res(t^{13} - 1, p(t)).

Using the resultant identity:
Res(f,g) = b_n^m ∏ f(β_j), where m = deg f, n = deg g, and β_j are the roots of g. Here f(t) = t^{13} - 1, g(t) = 2t^2 - 2t + 1, so:
∏_{k=0}^{12} p(ω^k) = 2^{13} ∏ (β^{13} - 1),
where β are the roots of g.

The roots are β = (1 ± i)/2. Take β1 = (1 + i)/2 = 2^{-1/2} e^{iπ/4}. Then
β1^{13} = 2^{-13/2} e^{i13π/4} = -2^{-13/2} e^{iπ/4},
so |β1^{13} - 1|^2 = |1 + 2^{-13/2} e^{iπ/4}|^2 = 1 + 2^{-13} + 2^{-13/2}√2.

Thus the product is:
2^{13}(1 + 2^{-13} + 2^{-13/2}√2) = 8192 + 1 + 128 = 8321.

Therefore the remainder modulo 1000 is 8321 mod 1000 = 321.

### Correctness Confirmation: 
The use of the resultant identity is appropriate and correctly applied. Root calculations and magnitude evaluations are accurate. Arithmetic yields the product 8321, giving remainder 321 modulo 1000. The solution is correct.
