C0003 say to All: ### Context Analysis:
We have a 2x3 grid with digits assigned to each cell. Let the top row be a, b, c and the bottom row be d, e, f. Two horizontal 3-digit numbers are formed by reading each row left to right, and three vertical 2-digit numbers are formed by reading each column top to bottom. The constraints are:
- The sum of the two 3-digit row numbers is 999.
- The sum of the three 2-digit column numbers is 99.
Leading zeros are allowed.

### Key Information Summary:
- Variables: a, b, c, d, e, f ∈ {0, 1, ..., 9}
- Row numbers: R1 = 100a + 10b + c, R2 = 100d + 10e + f with R1 + R2 = 999
- Column numbers: C1 = 10a + d, C2 = 10b + e, C3 = 10c + f with C1 + C2 + C3 = 99
- Column sum expands to: 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99 ⇒ a + b + c ∈ {8, 9} and d + e + f ∈ {19, 9}
- Digit-wise addition with carries for R1 + R2 = 999:
  - c + f = 9 + 10k1
  - b + e + k1 = 9 + 10k2
  - a + d + k2 = 9
  where k1, k2 ∈ {0, 1}
- Consistency with the column-sum constraint forces k1 = k2 = 0 and a + b + c = 8, d + e + f = 19
- Hence the constraints simplify to:
  - a + b + c = 8
  - a + d = 9
  - b + e = 9
  - c + f = 9
- Therefore, any choice of (a, b, c) with a + b + c = 8 uniquely determines (d, e, f) as d = 9 − a, e = 9 − b, f = 9 − c.

C0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:
- Let the 2x3 grid digits be:
  - Top row: a, b, c
  - Bottom row: d, e, f
  - All are digits 0–9 (leading zeros allowed in formed numbers, per example).
- Numbers formed left-to-right (rows):
  - R1 = 100a + 10b + c
  - R2 = 100d + 10e + f
  - Constraint: R1 + R2 = 999
- Numbers formed top-to-bottom (columns):
  - C1 = 10a + d, C2 = 10b + e, C3 = 10c + f
  - Constraint: C1 + C2 + C3 = 99
- Analyze R1 + R2 = 999 digitwise with carries:
  - Ones: c + f must have ones digit 9. Since max c + f = 18, c + f = 9 (19 impossible), so carry t1 = 0.
  - Tens: b + e + t1 must have ones digit 9. With t1 = 0 and max b + e = 18, we get b + e = 9, so carry t2 = 0.
  - Hundreds: a + d + t2 = 9 with no overflow; thus a + d = 9.
  - Therefore, d = 9 − a, e = 9 − b, f = 9 − c.
- Analyze C1 + C2 + C3 = 99:
  - C1 + C2 + C3 = (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f).
  - Using d + e + f = (9 − a) + (9 − b) + (9 − c) = 27 − (a + b + c),
    we obtain 10S + (27 − S) = 99, where S = a + b + c.
  - Hence 9S + 27 = 99 ⇒ 9S = 72 ⇒ S = a + b + c = 8.

### Proof Structure:
1. Define variables a, b, c, d, e, f as digits (0–9) in the 2x3 grid.
2. Impose row-sum condition R1 + R2 = 999 and perform digitwise addition:
   - Derive c + f = 9, b + e = 9, a + d = 9, with zero carries.
3. Impose column-sum condition C1 + C2 + C3 = 99:
   - Translate to 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.
   - Substitute d + e + f = 27 − (a + b + c) to get 9(a + b + c) = 72.
   - Conclude a + b + c = 8 and hence d = 9 − a, e = 9 − b, f = 9 − c.
4. Final modeled constraints:
   - Pairwise column complements: a + d = b + e = c + f = 9.
   - Top row sum fixed: a + b + c = 8.
   - Bottom row determined uniquely: d = 9 − a, e = 9 − b, f = 9 − c.

C0004 say to All: ### Calculations:
- Let the grid digits be:
  - Top row: a, b, c
  - Bottom row: d, e, f
- Row condition: (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
  - Units: c + f must end with 9; since c + f ≤ 18, c + f = 9 (no carry)
  - Tens: b + e must end with 9; since b + e ≤ 18, b + e = 9 (no carry)
  - Hundreds: a + d must equal 9 (no carry to thousands)
  - Therefore: d = 9 − a, e = 9 − b, f = 9 − c
- Column condition: (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99
  - This is 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
  - Substitute d + e + f = (9 − a) + (9 − b) + (9 − c) = 27 − (a + b + c)
  - Hence 10S + (27 − S) = 99 ⇒ 9S = 72 ⇒ S = a + b + c = 8

### Numerical Results:
- Constraints: d = 9 − a, e = 9 − b, f = 9 − c, with a + b + c = 8 and digits 0–9
- Number of valid arrangements (solutions for a, b, c): C(8 + 3 − 1, 3 − 1) = C(10, 2) = 45

C0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: The modeling is essentially correct. The grid was labeled consistently (top row: a, b, c; bottom row: d, e, f), and the two constraints were translated into equations properly. One subtle point that needs explicit justification is the “no carry” conclusion in the row-sum 3-digit addition: stating c+f ≤ 18 ⇒ c+f = 9 (no carry) should be supported by the fact that the ones digit must be 9 and 19 is impossible since 9+9=18. The same applies to the tens and hundreds places. Otherwise, the derived relations and the vertical sum reduction to a+b+c=8 are correct.

### Corrections:
- Justify the no-carry property explicitly:
  - Ones: c+f must give a ones digit 9, and since c+f ≤ 18, the only possibility is c+f=9 (19 is impossible), so carry to tens is 0.
  - Tens: b+e + 0 must give a ones digit 9, hence b+e=9 (no carry).
  - Hundreds: a+d + 0 must be 9, hence a+d=9 (no carry).
- Final modeled constraints:
  - Pairwise complements by column: d=9−a, e=9−b, f=9−c.
  - Vertical sum: (10a+d)+(10b+e)+(10c+f)=99 ⇒ 10(a+b+c)+(d+e+f)=99.
  - Using d+e+f = (9−a)+(9−b)+(9−c) = 27−(a+b+c), we get 10S + (27−S) = 99 ⇒ 9S=72 ⇒ a+b+c=8.
- Therefore, the complete constraint model is:
  - a, b, c, d, e, f ∈ {0,…,9}
  - d=9−a, e=9−b, f=9−c
  - a+b+c=8.

C0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: Let the grid digits be top row a, b, c and bottom row d, e, f (each 0–9). The left-to-right numbers are 100a+10b+c and 100d+10e+f with sum 999. Column-wise addition gives:
- Units: c+f must end in 9. Since c+f ≤ 18, 19 is impossible; hence c+f=9 (no carry).
- Tens: b+e must then be 9 (no carry from units; 19 is impossible).
- Hundreds: a+d must be 9 (no carry from tens).
Thus d=9−a, e=9−b, f=9−c.

Top-to-bottom sums are (10a+d)+(10b+e)+(10c+f)=99, which simplifies to 10(a+b+c)+(d+e+f)=99. Substituting d+e+f = (9−a)+(9−b)+(9−c) = 27−(a+b+c) yields 10S+(27−S)=99 ⇒ 9S=72 ⇒ S=a+b+c=8. Leading zeros are permitted as shown by the example, so no additional constraints apply.

Final modeled constraints: a, b, c ∈ {0,…,9} with a+b+c=8 and d=9−a, e=9−b, f=9−c.

### Correctness Confirmation: The derivation correctly handles digit bounds and carry possibilities, matches the example, and fully captures the problem’s constraints. The model is correct.

C0004 say to All: ### Calculations: 
Let the grid digits be:
Top row: a, b, c
Bottom row: d, e, f

Row-sum constraint (reading left-to-right as three-digit numbers):
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
=> 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
Let x = a + d, y = b + e, z = c + f with each in [0, 18]. Then:
100x + 10y + z = 999

Since 10y + z ≤ 198, we must have x = 9 to get near 999:
- If x = 9, then 10y + z = 99 with 0 ≤ y ≤ 18, 0 ≤ z ≤ 18. The only possibility is y = 9, z = 9.
- If x ≤ 8, then 10y + z ≥ 199 is impossible.

Thus x = y = z = 9, i.e., a + d = b + e = c + f = 9.

Column-sum constraint (reading top-to-bottom as two-digit numbers):
(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99
=> 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Using a + d = 9 etc., we get d = 9 − a, e = 9 − b, f = 9 − c, hence:
d + e + f = 27 − (a + b + c)

So:
10S + (27 − S) = 99, where S = a + b + c
=> 9S = 72 => S = 8

Thus (a, b, c) are nonnegative integers summing to 8, each ≤ 8 automatically. The number of solutions is C(8 + 3 − 1, 3 − 1) = C(10, 2) = 45, and each determines (d, e, f) uniquely by d = 9 − a, e = 9 − b, f = 9 − c.

Let the grid digits be:
- Top row: a, b, c
- Bottom row: d, e, f

The two 3-digit numbers formed left-to-right are abc and def, and abc + def = 999. Column-wise addition without exceeding 9 implies no carries; hence:
a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9,
so d = 9 − a, e = 9 − b, f = 9 − c.

The three 2-digit numbers formed top-to-bottom are 10a + d, 10b + e, 10c + f. Their sum is:
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.
Let S = a + b + c. Since d + e + f = 27 − S, we get:
10S + (27 − S) = 99 ⇒ 9S + 27 = 99 ⇒ S = 8.

Thus a, b, c are nonnegative integers summing to 8, each at most 8 ≤ 9, so all digit constraints are satisfied. The number of solutions is the number of compositions of 8 into 3 nonnegative parts:
C(8 + 3 − 1, 3 − 1) = C(10, 2) = 45.
Each determines a unique (d, e, f) via complements to 9.

### Proof Structure:
- Define variables a, b, c (top row) and d, e, f (bottom row).
- From abc + def = 999, deduce columnwise: a + d = b + e = c + f = 9 (no carries possible).
- Hence d = 9 − a, e = 9 − b, f = 9 − c.
- Sum of vertical numbers: 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99 ⇒ with d + e + f = 27 − (a + b + c), obtain S = a + b + c = 8.
- Count nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8: C(10, 2) = 45.
- Therefore, the number of valid grids is 45.
----END MESSAGE----

C0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: 
- A common mistake is allowing a carry from the units place in the row-sum (c+f=19), which is impossible since digits are at most 9 (max sum 18). Hence r1 must be 0, so c+f=9. Similarly, b+e must be 9 and a+d must be 9 (no carries).
- For the column-sum, failing to enforce consistency via total sums can lead to errors. Using a+d=9, b+e=9, c+f=9 implies (a+b+c)+(d+e+f)=27. Combined with 10(a+b+c)+(d+e+f)=99, this forces u=1, so a+b+c=8 and d+e+f=19.
- Another potential error is imposing unnecessary upper bounds on top digits; since a+b+c=8, each top digit is automatically ≤8, so constraints 0–9 are naturally satisfied.
- Leading zeros are permitted (as shown by the example 008 and 09). Excluding them would undercount.

### Corrections: 
- Correct constraints:
  - a+d=9, b+e=9, c+f=9
  - a+b+c=8, d+e+f=19
- Count reduces to the number of nonnegative integer solutions to x1+x2+x3=8, which is C(10,2)=45.
- Final answer: 45

Row-sum condition: (100a+10b+c) + (100d+10e+f) = 999. Column-sum condition: (10a+d) + (10b+e) + (10c+f) = 99, i.e., 10(a+b+c) + (d+e+f) = 99.

From the row sum, perform column-wise addition with carries:
- Units: c+f ≡ 9 (mod 10) and 0 ≤ c+f ≤ 18 ⇒ c+f = 9, carry u=0.
- Tens: b+e + u ≡ 9 (mod 10) with 0 ≤ b+e ≤ 18 and u=0 ⇒ b+e = 9, carry v=0.
- Hundreds: a+d + v = 9 with v=0 ⇒ a+d = 9.

Thus a+d=9, b+e=9, c+f=9. Let S = a+b+c. Then d+e+f = 27 − S. The column-sum condition gives 10S + (27 − S) = 99 ⇒ 9S + 27 = 99 ⇒ S = 8.

Hence count the number of nonnegative integer solutions (a,b,c) with a+b+c=8 (each ≤ 8 ≤ 9, so digit bounds are automatic): C(8+3−1, 3−1) = C(10,2) = 45. For each such triple, d=9−a, e=9−b, f=9−c are valid digits and satisfy all conditions.

### Correctness Confirmation: The derivation correctly handles carries, enforces both sum constraints, and counts all valid configurations. Final answer: 45.

C0003 say to All: ### Context Analysis:
We have a 2x3 grid with top row digits a, b, c and bottom row digits d, e, f (each 0–9). The two 3-digit numbers formed by rows sum to 999:
100(a+d) + 10(b+e) + (c+f) = 999.
The three 2-digit numbers formed by columns sum to 99:
10(a+b+c) + (d+e+f) = 99.

From 100(a+d) + 10(b+e) + (c+f) = 999, reducing mod 10 and mod 100 yields:
c+f = 9, b+e = 9, and a+d = 9.
Thus each column’s digits sum to 9.

Then d+e+f = 27 − (a+b+c). Plugging into the column-sum equation:
10(a+b+c) + (27 − (a+b+c)) = 99 ⇒ 9(a+b+c) = 72 ⇒ a+b+c = 8.

Each choice of (a,b,c) with sum 8 uniquely determines (d,e,f) = (9−a, 9−b, 9−c). Leading zeros are allowed (as shown in the example), so no extra restrictions apply.

### Key Information Summary:
- Variables: digits a,b,c (top), d,e,f (bottom).
- Row-sum 999 ⇒ a+d = b+e = c+f = 9.
- Column-sum 99 ⇒ 10(a+b+c) + (d+e+f) = 99.
- Substitute d+e+f = 27 − (a+b+c) ⇒ a+b+c = 8.
- Count of (a,b,c) ∈ {0,…,9} with sum 8: C(10,2) = 45.
- Each such (a,b,c) uniquely gives (d,e,f) = (9−a,9−b,9−c).
- Total valid grids: 45.
