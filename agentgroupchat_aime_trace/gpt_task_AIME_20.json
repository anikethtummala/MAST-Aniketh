Moreover, x ≤ s gives y = s − x ≥ 0, and s ≤ b − 1 gives y ≤ b − 1. Thus 1 ≤ x ≤ b − 1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b − 1.\\n  - The sum condition holds: x + y = s = √n.\\n- Therefore, b-eautiful integers are exactly those n of the form n = s^2 with s in the range ceil(√b) ≤ s ≤ b − 1 satisfying s(s − 1) ≡ 0 mod (b − 1).\\n- The range is necessary and sufficient: since n is two-digit, b ≤ n ≤ b^2 − 1, hence √b ≤ s ≤ b − 1, i.e., s ∈ [ceil(√b), b − 1]. Conversely, any s in this interval yields b ≤ s^2 ≤ b^2 − 1.\\n- Counting framework: Let m = b − 1. The congruence s(s − 1) ≡ 0 mod m is equivalent, for each prime power p^e || m, to s ≡ 0 mod p^e or s ≡ 1 mod p^e (since s and s − 1 are coprime). By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the solution set modulo m consists of exactly 2^{ω(m)} residue classes, where ω(m) is the number of distinct prime factors of m.

Writing n in base b as n = xb + y with 1 ≤ x ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b−1, the condition x + y = s = √n must hold with s an integer. Substituting y = s − x into s^2 = xb + y yields x(b−1) = s(s−1), i.e., s^2 − s ≡ 0 (mod b−1). The two-digit condition imposes b ≤ n ≤ b^2 − 1, so on s this gives ceil(√b) ≤ s ≤ b−1. Conversely, if s in this range satisfies (b−1) | s(s−1), then x = s(s−1)/(b−1) and y = s − x are valid digits (1 ≤ x ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b−1), and xb + y = s^2, so n is b-eautiful. Thus counting b-eautiful integers is equivalent to counting integers s in [ceil(√b), b−1] with s(s−1) divisible by b−1.\\n\\n### Key Information Summary:\\n- Two-digit base-b representation: n = xb + y with 1 ≤ x ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b−1.\\n- Let s = √n = x + y ∈ Z; then s^2 = xb + y and y = s − x.\\n- Eliminating y gives x(b−1) = s(s−1), so s^2 − s ≡ 0 (mod b−1).\\n- Two-digit bound on n implies s ∈ [ceil(√b), b−1].\\n- For any s in this range with (b−1) | s(s−1), define x = s(s−1)/(b−1), y = s − x; these are valid digits and xb + y = s^2.\\n- Therefore, the count of b-eautiful integers equals the count of s in [ceil(√b), b−1] satisfying s(s−1) ≡ 0 (mod b−1).\\n- Solution structure modulo m = b−1: s ≡ 0 or 1 modulo each prime power dividing m; by CRT there are exactly 2^{ω(b−1)} valid residue classes mod m, forming the basis for counting within the interval.\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- Let n be b-eautiful. Then n has exactly two base-b digits: n = xb + y with 1 ≤ x ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b−1, and by definition the sum of these two digits equals √n. Set s = √n; the condition is s = x + y and s is an integer.\\n- From s^2 = n = xb + y and s = x + y, subtract to obtain s^2 − s = x(b − 1). Hence (b − 1) divides s(s − 1).\\n- Conversely, suppose s is an integer with ceil(√b) ≤ s ≤ b − 1 and (b − 1) | s(s − 1). Define x = s(s − 1)/(b − 1) and y = s − x. Then:\\n  - xb + y = [s(s − 1)/(b − 1)] b + s − [s(s − 1)/(b − 1)] = s + s(s − 1) = s^2, so n = s^2.\\n  - Digit bounds: since s ≥ 2 for b ≥ 3 and (b − 1) | s(s − 1), we have x ≥ 1; also s ≤ b − 1 implies s(s − 1) ≤ (b − 1)(b − 2), so x ≤ b − 2 < b − 1. Moreover, x ≤ s gives y = s − x ≥ 0, and s ≤ b − 1 gives y ≤ b − 1. Thus 1 ≤ x ≤ b − 1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b − 1.\\n  - The sum condition holds: x + y = s = √n.\\n- Therefore, b-eautiful integers are exactly those n of the form n = s^2 with s in the range ceil(√b) ≤ s ≤ b − 1 satisfying s(s − 1) ≡ 0 mod (b − 1).\\n- The range is necessary and sufficient: since n is two-digit, b ≤ n ≤ b^2 − 1, hence √b ≤ s ≤ b − 1, i.e., s ∈ [ceil(√b), b − 1]. Conversely, any s in this interval yields b ≤ s^2 ≤ b^2 − 1.\\n- Counting framework: Let m = b − 1. The congruence s(s − 1) ≡ 0 mod m is equivalent, for each prime power p^e || m, to s ≡ 0 mod p^e or s ≡ 1 mod p^e (since s and s − 1 are coprime). By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the solution set modulo m consists of exactly 2^{ω(m)} residue classes, where ω(m) is the number of distinct prime factors of m. The number of b-eautiful integers equals the count of s ∈ [ceil(√b), b − 1] lying in this union of residue classes.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Represent a two-digit base-b integer as n = xb + y with digit bounds.\\n2. Impose the sum-of-digits condition s = √n = x + y and derive s^2 − s = x(b − 1), yielding (b − 1) | s(s − 1).\\n3. Establish the s-range from the two-digit condition: b ≤ s^2 ≤ b^2 − 1 gives ceil(√b) ≤ s ≤ b − 1.\\n4. Construct digits from s satisfying the divisibility: x = s(s − 1)/(b − 1), y = s − x, and verify:\\n   - xb + y = s^2,\\n   - 1 ≤ x ≤ b − 1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b − 1,\\n   - x + y = s.\\n5.

Writing n in base b as n = xb + y with 1 ≤ x ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b−1, the condition x + y = s = √n must hold with s an integer. Substituting y = s − x into s^2 = xb + y yields x(b−1) = s(s−1), i.e., s^2 − s ≡ 0 (mod b−1). The two-digit condition imposes b ≤ n ≤ b^2 − 1, so on s this gives ceil(√b) ≤ s ≤ b−1. Conversely, if s in this range satisfies (b−1) | s(s−1), then x = s(s−1)/(b−1) and y = s − x are valid digits (1 ≤ x ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b−1), and xb + y = s^2, so n is b-eautiful. Thus counting b-eautiful integers is equivalent to counting integers s in [ceil(√b), b−1] with s(s−1) divisible by b−1.\\n\\n### Key Information Summary:\\n- Two-digit base-b representation: n = xb + y with 1 ≤ x ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b−1.\\n- Let s = √n = x + y ∈ Z; then s^2 = xb + y and y = s − x.\\n- Eliminating y gives x(b−1) = s(s−1), so s^2 − s ≡ 0 (mod b−1).\\n- Two-digit bound on n implies s ∈ [ceil(√b), b−1].\\n- For any s in this range with (b−1) | s(s−1), define x = s(s−1)/(b−1), y = s − x; these are valid digits and xb + y = s^2.\\n- Therefore, the count of b-eautiful integers equals the count of s in [ceil(√b), b−1] satisfying s(s−1) ≡ 0 (mod b−1).\\n- Solution structure modulo m = b−1: s ≡ 0 or 1 modulo each prime power dividing m; by CRT there are exactly 2^{ω(b−1)} valid residue classes mod m, forming the basis for counting within the interval.\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- Let n be b-eautiful. Then n has exactly two base-b digits: n = xb + y with 1 ≤ x ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b−1, and by definition the sum of these two digits equals √n. Set s = √n; the condition is s = x + y and s is an integer.\\n- From s^2 = n = xb + y and s = x + y, subtract to obtain s^2 − s = x(b − 1). Hence (b − 1) divides s(s − 1).\\n- Conversely, suppose s is an integer with ceil(√b) ≤ s ≤ b − 1 and (b − 1) | s(s − 1). Define x = s(s − 1)/(b − 1) and y = s − x. Then:\\n  - xb + y = [s(s − 1)/(b − 1)] b + s − [s(s − 1)/(b − 1)] = s + s(s − 1) = s^2, so n = s^2.\\n  - Digit bounds: since s ≥ 2 for b ≥ 3 and (b − 1) | s(s − 1), we have x ≥ 1; also s ≤ b − 1 implies s(s − 1) ≤ (b − 1)(b − 2), so x ≤ b − 2 < b − 1. Moreover, x ≤ s gives y = s − x ≥ 0, and s ≤ b − 1 gives y ≤ b − 1. Thus 1 ≤ x ≤ b − 1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b − 1.\\n  - The sum condition holds: x + y = s = √n.\\n- Therefore, b-eautiful integers are exactly those n of the form n = s^2 with s in the range ceil(√b) ≤ s ≤ b − 1 satisfying s(s − 1) ≡ 0 mod (b − 1).\\n- The range is necessary and sufficient: since n is two-digit, b ≤ n ≤ b^2 − 1, hence √b ≤ s ≤ b − 1, i.e., s ∈ [ceil(√b), b − 1]. Conversely, any s in this interval yields b ≤ s^2 ≤ b^2 − 1.\\n- Counting framework: Let m = b − 1. The congruence s(s − 1) ≡ 0 mod m is equivalent, for each prime power p^e || m, to s ≡ 0 mod p^e or s ≡ 1 mod p^e (since s and s − 1 are coprime). By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the solution set modulo m consists of exactly 2^{ω(m)} residue classes, where ω(m) is the number of distinct prime factors of m. The number of b-eautiful integers equals the count of s ∈ [ceil(√b), b − 1] lying in this union of residue classes.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Represent a two-digit base-b integer as n = xb + y with digit bounds.\\n2. Impose the sum-of-digits condition s = √n = x + y and derive s^2 − s = x(b − 1), yielding (b − 1) | s(s − 1).\\n3. Establish the s-range from the two-digit condition: b ≤ s^2 ≤ b^2 − 1 gives ceil(√b) ≤ s ≤ b − 1.\\n4. Construct digits from s satisfying the divisibility: x = s(s − 1)/(b − 1), y = s − x, and verify:\\n   - xb + y = s^2,\\n   - 1 ≤ x ≤ b − 1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b − 1,\\n   - x + y = s.\\n5. Conclude equivalence: b-eautiful integers are exactly squares s^2 with s in [ceil(√b), b − 1] and (b − 1) | s(s − 1).\\n6. For counting, reduce to congruences modulo m = b − 1; solve via CRT to obtain 2^{ω(m)} residue classes, then count s in the interval lying in these classes.\\nC0004 say to All: ### Calculations:\\n- Write any two-digit base-b integer as n = xb + y with 1 ≤ x ≤ b − 1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b − 1.

Writing n in base b as n = xb + y with 1 ≤ x ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b−1, the condition x + y = s = √n must hold with s an integer. Substituting y = s − x into s^2 = xb + y yields x(b−1) = s(s−1), i.e., s^2 − s ≡ 0 (mod b−1). The two-digit condition imposes b ≤ n ≤ b^2 − 1, so on s this gives ceil(√b) ≤ s ≤ b−1. Conversely, if s in this range satisfies (b−1) | s(s−1), then x = s(s−1)/(b−1) and y = s − x are valid digits (1 ≤ x ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b−1), and xb + y = s^2, so n is b-eautiful. Thus counting b-eautiful integers is equivalent to counting integers s in [ceil(√b), b−1] with s(s−1) divisible by b−1.\\n\\n### Key Information Summary:\\n- Two-digit base-b representation: n = xb + y with 1 ≤ x ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b−1.\\n- Let s = √n = x + y ∈ Z; then s^2 = xb + y and y = s − x.\\n- Eliminating y gives x(b−1) = s(s−1), so s^2 − s ≡ 0 (mod b−1).\\n- Two-digit bound on n implies s ∈ [ceil(√b), b−1].\\n- For any s in this range with (b−1) | s(s−1), define x = s(s−1)/(b−1), y = s − x; these are valid digits and xb + y = s^2.\\n- Therefore, the count of b-eautiful integers equals the count of s in [ceil(√b), b−1] satisfying s(s−1) ≡ 0 (mod b−1).\\n- Solution structure modulo m = b−1: s ≡ 0 or 1 modulo each prime power dividing m; by CRT there are exactly 2^{ω(b−1)} valid residue classes mod m, forming the basis for counting within the interval.\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- Let n be b-eautiful. Then n has exactly two base-b digits: n = xb + y with 1 ≤ x ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b−1, and by definition the sum of these two digits equals √n. Set s = √n; the condition is s = x + y and s is an integer.\\n- From s^2 = n = xb + y and s = x + y, subtract to obtain s^2 − s = x(b − 1). Hence (b − 1) divides s(s − 1).\\n- Conversely, suppose s is an integer with ceil(√b) ≤ s ≤ b − 1 and (b − 1) | s(s − 1). Define x = s(s − 1)/(b − 1) and y = s − x. Then:\\n  - xb + y = [s(s − 1)/(b − 1)] b + s − [s(s − 1)/(b − 1)] = s + s(s − 1) = s^2, so n = s^2.\\n  - Digit bounds: since s ≥ 2 for b ≥ 3 and (b − 1) | s(s − 1), we have x ≥ 1; also s ≤ b − 1 implies s(s − 1) ≤ (b − 1)(b − 2), so x ≤ b − 2 < b − 1. Moreover, x ≤ s gives y = s − x ≥ 0, and s ≤ b − 1 gives y ≤ b − 1. Thus 1 ≤ x ≤ b − 1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b − 1.\\n  - The sum condition holds: x + y = s = √n.\\n- Therefore, b-eautiful integers are exactly those n of the form n = s^2 with s in the range ceil(√b) ≤ s ≤ b − 1 satisfying s(s − 1) ≡ 0 mod (b − 1).\\n- The range is necessary and sufficient: since n is two-digit, b ≤ n ≤ b^2 − 1, hence √b ≤ s ≤ b − 1, i.e., s ∈ [ceil(√b), b − 1]. Conversely, any s in this interval yields b ≤ s^2 ≤ b^2 − 1.\\n- Counting framework: Let m = b − 1. The congruence s(s − 1) ≡ 0 mod m is equivalent, for each prime power p^e || m, to s ≡ 0 mod p^e or s ≡ 1 mod p^e (since s and s − 1 are coprime). By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the solution set modulo m consists of exactly 2^{ω(m)} residue classes, where ω(m) is the number of distinct prime factors of m. The number of b-eautiful integers equals the count of s ∈ [ceil(√b), b − 1] lying in this union of residue classes.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Represent a two-digit base-b integer as n = xb + y with digit bounds.\\n2. Impose the sum-of-digits condition s = √n = x + y and derive s^2 − s = x(b − 1), yielding (b − 1) | s(s − 1).\\n3. Establish the s-range from the two-digit condition: b ≤ s^2 ≤ b^2 − 1 gives ceil(√b) ≤ s ≤ b − 1.\\n4. Construct digits from s satisfying the divisibility: x = s(s − 1)/(b − 1), y = s − x, and verify:\\n   - xb + y = s^2,\\n   - 1 ≤ x ≤ b − 1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b − 1,\\n   - x + y = s.\\n5. Conclude equivalence: b-eautiful integers are exactly squares s^2 with s in [ceil(√b), b − 1] and (b − 1) | s(s − 1).\\n6. For counting, reduce to congruences modulo m = b − 1; solve via CRT to obtain 2^{ω(m)} residue classes, then count s in the interval lying in these classes.\\nC0004 say to All: ### Calculations:\\n- Write any two-digit base-b integer as n = xb + y with 1 ≤ x ≤ b − 1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b − 1. If n is b-eautiful, then √n is an integer; set s = √n. The condition “digits sum to √n” means s = x + y, and n = s^2 = xb + y.\\n- Subtracting gives s^2 − s = x(b − 1). Hence b − 1 divides s(s − 1):\\n  s(s − 1) ≡ 0 mod (b − 1).\\n- Conversely, if s is an integer with s(s − 1) ≡ 0 mod (b − 1), define\\n  x = s(s − 1)/(b − 1), y = s − x = s(b − s)/(b − 1).\\n  For s ≤ b − 1, one checks 1 ≤ x ≤ s − 1 and 1 ≤ y ≤ s ≤ b − 1, so x and y are valid digits and n = s^2 = xb + y with x + y = s.\\n- Two-digit condition forces b ≤ n = s^2 ≤ b^2 − 1, hence\\n  s ∈ [ceil(√b), b − 1].\\n- Let m = b − 1 and write m = ∏ p_i^{e_i}. The congruence s(s − 1) ≡ 0 mod m is equivalent to\\n  s ≡ 0 or 1 mod p_i^{e_i} for each i.\\n  By the Chinese Remainder Theorem this yields exactly 2^{ω(m)} residue classes modulo m, where ω(m) is the number of distinct prime divisors of m.\\n- Since the interval [ceil(√b), b − 1] has length less than m, each valid residue class contributes at most one s to this interval.

If n is b-eautiful, set s = √n = x + y (an integer). Then n = s^2 and\\n  s^2 − s = x(b − 1) ⇒ (b − 1) | s(s − 1).\\n\\n- Two-digit condition b ≤ n ≤ b^2 − 1 gives the s-range:\\n  ceil(√b) ≤ s ≤ b − 1.\\n\\n- Conversely, if s in this range satisfies (b − 1) | s(s − 1), define\\n  x = s(s − 1)/(b − 1), y = s − x = s(b − s)/(b − 1). These are valid digits and xb + y = s^2 with x + y = s. Hence b-eautiful integers correspond exactly to squares s^2 with s in [ceil(√b), b−1] and (b−1) | s(s−1).\\n\\n- Let m = b − 1. For each prime power p^e || m, s ≡ 0 or 1 (mod p^e); by CRT this yields exactly 2^{ω(m)} solution classes modulo m. The interval [ceil(√b), b−1] has length < m, so each residue class contributes at most one s. Thus the count of b-eautiful integers equals the number of those residue classes that fall within this interval.\\nC0004 say to All: ### Calculations: \\n- Let m = b − 1 and s = √n. Two-digit in base b implies s ∈ [ceil(√b), b−1] = [ceil(√(m+1)), m].\\n- The condition x + y = s with n = s^2 = xb + y gives x = (s^2 − s)/(b − 1), so we need m | s(s − 1). \\n- The number of solutions modulo m of s(s − 1) ≡ 0 (mod m) is 2^{ω(m)}, where ω(m) is the number of distinct prime factors of m.\\n- Since the interval length is less than m, the number of valid s is at most 2^{ω(m)}. To have > 10 solutions, need 2^{ω(m)} ≥ 11 ⇒ ω(m) ≥ 4.\\n- The smallest m with ω(m) = 4 is m = 2·3·5·7 = 210, so the minimal candidate is b = m + 1 = 211.\\n- For b = 211: m = 210, R = 2^{ω(m)} = 16. S0 = ceil(√211) = 15. Among residues 0 ≤ r ≤ 14 that satisfy r ≡ 0 or 1 mod 2,3,5,7, only r = 1 qualifies (r = 0 corresponds to s = m, which is included). Hence excluded count is 1, giving 16 − 1 = 15 > 10.\\n- For any m < 210, ω(m) ≤ 3, so R ≤ 8, which cannot exceed 10.\\n\\n### Numerical Results: 211\\n\\nIn this chat turn, you can take up to 3 actions, currently on action 1.

Two-digit in base b implies s ∈ [ceil(√b), b−1] = [ceil(√(m+1)), m].\\n- The condition x + y = s with n = s^2 = xb + y gives x = (s^2 − s)/(b − 1), so we need m | s(s − 1). \\n- The number of solutions modulo m of s(s − 1) ≡ 0 (mod m) is 2^{ω(m)}, where ω(m) is the number of distinct prime factors of m.\\n- Since the interval length is less than m, the number of valid s is at most 2^{ω(m)}. To have > 10 solutions, need 2^{ω(m)} ≥ 11 ⇒ ω(m) ≥ 4.\\n- The smallest m with ω(m) = 4 is m = 2·3·5·7 = 210, so the minimal candidate is b = m + 1 = 211.\\n- For b = 211: m = 210, R = 2^{ω(m)} = 16. S0 = ceil(√211) = 15. Among residues 0 ≤ r ≤ 14 that satisfy r ≡ 0 or 1 mod 2,3,5,7, only r = 1 qualifies (r = 0 corresponds to s = m, which is included). Hence excluded count is 1, giving 16 − 1 = 15 > 10.\\n- For any m < 210, ω(m) ≤ 3, so R ≤ 8, which cannot exceed 10.\\n\\n### Numerical Results: 211\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- A two-digit base-b number has the form n = xb + y with 1 ≤ x ≤ b−1, 0 ≤ y ≤ b−1. If n is b-eautiful, then x + y = s = √n is an integer, and n = s^2 = xb + y.\\n- Eliminating x, y via s gives y = s(b − s)/(b − 1). Let m = b − 1. Then y is an integer iff m | s(b − s). This is equivalent to m | (s^2 − s) = s(s − 1).\\n- For two-digit constraint: since s^2 = n < b^2, we need s ≤ b − 1 = m; and since n ≥ b, we need s ≥ ⌈√b⌉ = ⌈√(m + 1)⌉. Also x = (s^2 − s)/m must be ≥ 1, which excludes s = 1; but s ≥ ⌈√(m + 1)⌉ ≥ 2 already excludes s = 1.\\n- The number of solutions to s(s−1) ≡ 0 (mod m) in {1, 2, ..., m} equals 2^{ω(m)}, where ω(m) is the number of distinct prime factors of m. This follows since for each prime power p^e ∥ m, s ≡ 0 or 1 (mod p^e), and these conditions are independent by CRT.\\n- Valid b-eautiful integers correspond to those solutions with s ≥ L = ⌈√(m + 1)⌉. Hence the count is 2^{ω(m)} minus the number T of such solutions with s < L.\\n\\nTo have more than 10 b-eautiful integers, we need 2^{ω(m)} − T ≥ 11. Since 2^3 = 8 < 11, we must have ω(m) ≥ 4. The smallest m with ω(m) = 4 is 2·3·5·7 = 210, giving b = m + 1 = 211.\\n\\nFor m = 210, L = ⌈√211⌉ = 15. We must count T, the number of s ∈ {1, ..., 14} with s ≡ 0 or 1 modulo each of 2, 3, 5, 7. Checking s < 15 shows the only solution is s = 1. Therefore T = 1, and the number of valid s is 2^{4} − 1 = 16 − 1 = 15 > 10.\\n\\nFor any m < 210, ω(m) ≤ 3, so the total number of solutions is ≤ 8 and after the lower bound it is ≤ 7 < 11. Thus no smaller base works.\\n\\nTherefore, the least base is b = 211.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Set up: Let n = xb + y, with x + y = s = √n, and derive y = s(b − s)/(b − 1).\\n2. Congruence condition: Equivalently, m = b − 1 divides s(s − 1).\\n3. Range for s: s ∈ [⌈√(m + 1)⌉, m] ensures two-digit and positivity constraints; s = 1 excluded automatically by the lower bound.\\n4. Counting solutions: Exactly 2^{ω(m)} solutions in [1, m] via CRT, one for each choice s ≡ 0 or 1 modulo p^e for each distinct prime p^e ∥ m.\\n5. Minimality logic: To exceed 10, need ω(m) ≥ 4. Smallest such m is 210, yielding b = 211.\\n6. Verification for m = 210: With L = 15, only s = 1 lies below L among the 16 classes, so 15 valid s remain; hence > 10 b-eautiful integers.\\n7. Conclude minimal base: b = 211.\\nC0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis:\\n- The reduction to s^2 ≡ s (mod b−1) is correct, and deriving digit formulas d1 = s(s−1)/(b−1), d0 = s(b−s)/(b−1) is valid. However, the necessary s-range must be explicitly s ∈ [ceil(√b), b−1], not up to b, since s=b would give n=b^2 which is three digits in base b.\\n- Counting solutions via residues modulo m=b−1: the number of residue classes satisfying s(s−1)≡0 (mod m) is 2^ω(m), where ω(m) is the number of distinct prime factors of m. Since our interval [ceil(√b), b−1] fits strictly within a single period of length m (indeed length ≤ m−1 for b≥3), at least the residue class s≡1 (mod m) is always missed. Hence the maximum possible count is ≤ 2^ω−1. Therefore, having more than 10 solutions requires ω≥4; ω≤3 cannot suffice.\\n- Minimal m with ω(m)≥4 is 210=2·3·5·7, so minimal b is 211. One must still verify the count exceeds 10 for b=211.\\n\\n### Corrections:\\n- Use the correct s-range: s ∈ [ceil(√b), b−1].\\n- Justify necessity: In any case, count ≤ 2^ω(b−1)−1, so ω≥4 is necessary for >10 solutions.\\n- For b=211 (m=210, ω=4), there are exactly 2^4=16 solution classes modulo 210. The count in [15,210] equals 16 minus the number of solution residues in {1,…,14} (with residue 0 accounted by s=210). Checking 1…14 shows only 1 is valid, so count = 16−1 = 15 > 10.\\n- Therefore, the least base with more than ten b-eautiful integers is 211.\\n\\nIn this chat turn, you can take up to 3 actions, currently on action 1.

To have > 10 solutions, need 2^{ω(m)} ≥ 11 ⇒ ω(m) ≥ 4.\\n- The smallest m with ω(m) = 4 is m = 2·3·5·7 = 210, so the minimal candidate is b = m + 1 = 211.\\n- For b = 211: m = 210, R = 2^{ω(m)} = 16.

Hence excluded count is 1, giving 16 − 1 = 15 > 10.\\n- For any m < 210, ω(m) ≤ 3, so R ≤ 8, which cannot exceed 10.\\n\\n### Numerical Results: 211\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- A two-digit base-b number has the form n = xb + y with 1 ≤ x ≤ b−1, 0 ≤ y ≤ b−1. If n is b-eautiful, then x + y = s = √n is an integer, and n = s^2 = xb + y.\\n- Eliminating x, y via s gives y = s(b − s)/(b − 1). Let m = b − 1. Then y is an integer iff m | s(b − s). This is equivalent to m | (s^2 − s) = s(s − 1).\\n- For two-digit constraint: since s^2 = n < b^2, we need s ≤ b − 1 = m; and since n ≥ b, we need s ≥ ⌈√b⌉ = ⌈√(m + 1)⌉. Also x = (s^2 − s)/m must be ≥ 1, which excludes s = 1; but s ≥ ⌈√(m + 1)⌉ ≥ 2 already excludes s = 1.\\n- The number of solutions to s(s−1) ≡ 0 (mod m) in {1, 2, ..., m} equals 2^{ω(m)}, where ω(m) is the number of distinct prime factors of m. This follows since for each prime power p^e ∥ m, s ≡ 0 or 1 (mod p^e), and these conditions are independent by CRT.\\n- Valid b-eautiful integers correspond to those solutions with s ≥ L = ⌈√(m + 1)⌉. Hence the count is 2^{ω(m)} minus the number T of such solutions with s < L.\\n\\nTo have more than 10 b-eautiful integers, we need 2^{ω(m)} − T ≥ 11. Since 2^3 = 8 < 11, we must have ω(m) ≥ 4. The smallest m with ω(m) = 4 is 2·3·5·7 = 210, giving b = m + 1 = 211.\\n\\nFor m = 210, L = ⌈√211⌉ = 15. We must count T, the number of s ∈ {1, ..., 14} with s ≡ 0 or 1 modulo each of 2, 3, 5, 7. Checking s < 15 shows the only solution is s = 1. Therefore T = 1, and the number of valid s is 2^{4} − 1 = 16 − 1 = 15 > 10.\\n\\nFor any m < 210, ω(m) ≤ 3, so the total number of solutions is ≤ 8 and after the lower bound it is ≤ 7 < 11. Thus no smaller base works.\\n\\nTherefore, the least base is b = 211.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Set up: Let n = xb + y, with x + y = s = √n, and derive y = s(b − s)/(b − 1).\\n2. Congruence condition: Equivalently, m = b − 1 divides s(s − 1).\\n3. Range for s: s ∈ [⌈√(m + 1)⌉, m] ensures two-digit and positivity constraints; s = 1 excluded automatically by the lower bound.\\n4. Counting solutions: Exactly 2^{ω(m)} solutions in [1, m] via CRT, one for each choice s ≡ 0 or 1 modulo p^e for each distinct prime p^e ∥ m.\\n5. Minimality logic: To exceed 10, need ω(m) ≥ 4. Smallest such m is 210, yielding b = 211.\\n6. Verification for m = 210: With L = 15, only s = 1 lies below L among the 16 classes, so 15 valid s remain; hence > 10 b-eautiful integers.\\n7. Conclude minimal base: b = 211.\\nC0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis:\\n- The reduction to s^2 ≡ s (mod b−1) is correct, and deriving digit formulas d1 = s(s−1)/(b−1), d0 = s(b−s)/(b−1) is valid. However, the necessary s-range must be explicitly s ∈ [ceil(√b), b−1], not up to b, since s=b would give n=b^2 which is three digits in base b.\\n- Counting solutions via residues modulo m=b−1: the number of residue classes satisfying s(s−1)≡0 (mod m) is 2^ω(m), where ω(m) is the number of distinct prime factors of m. Since our interval [ceil(√b), b−1] fits strictly within a single period of length m (indeed length ≤ m−1 for b≥3), at least the residue class s≡1 (mod m) is always missed. Hence the maximum possible count is ≤ 2^ω−1. Therefore, having more than 10 solutions requires ω≥4; ω≤3 cannot suffice.\\n- Minimal m with ω(m)≥4 is 210=2·3·5·7, so minimal b is 211. One must still verify the count exceeds 10 for b=211.\\n\\n### Corrections:\\n- Use the correct s-range: s ∈ [ceil(√b), b−1].\\n- Justify necessity: In any case, count ≤ 2^ω(b−1)−1, so ω≥4 is necessary for >10 solutions.\\n- For b=211 (m=210, ω=4), there are exactly 2^4=16 solution classes modulo 210. The count in [15,210] equals 16 minus the number of solution residues in {1,…,14} (with residue 0 accounted by s=210). Checking 1…14 shows only 1 is valid, so count = 16−1 = 15 > 10.\\n- Therefore, the least base with more than ten b-eautiful integers is 211.\\nC0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: \\nLet n be two-digit in base b, so n = ab + c with 1 ≤ a ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b−1.

If n is b-eautiful, set s = √n = x + y (an integer). Then n = s^2 and\\n  s^2 − s = x(b − 1) ⇒ (b − 1) | s(s − 1).\\n\\n- Two-digit condition b ≤ n ≤ b^2 − 1 gives the s-range:\\n  ceil(√b) ≤ s ≤ b − 1.\\n\\n- Conversely, if s in this range satisfies (b − 1) | s(s − 1), define\\n  x = s(s − 1)/(b − 1), y = s − x = s(b − s)/(b − 1). These are valid digits and xb + y = s^2 with x + y = s. Hence b-eautiful integers correspond exactly to squares s^2 with s in [ceil(√b), b−1] and (b−1) | s(s−1).\\n\\n- Let m = b − 1. For each prime power p^e || m, s ≡ 0 or 1 (mod p^e); by CRT this yields exactly 2^{ω(m)} solution classes modulo m. The interval [ceil(√b), b−1] has length < m, so each residue class contributes at most one s. Thus the count of b-eautiful integers equals the number of those residue classes that fall within this interval.\\nSystem say to All: - Set m = b − 1 and s = √n. A two-digit n in base b implies s ∈ [ceil(√b), b − 1].\\n- From n = xb + y and x + y = s, derive y = s(b − s)/(b − 1).
