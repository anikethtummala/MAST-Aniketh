C0003 say to All: ### Context Analysis:
We have a disphenoid (isosceles tetrahedron) where opposite edges are equal: AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, BC=AD=√89. Such a tetrahedron admits a symmetric coordinate model using three mutually orthogonal vectors x, y, z, placing vertices at A = x + y + z, B = x − y − z, C = −x + y − z, D = −x − y + z. Opposite edge lengths then correspond to 2√(y^2+z^2), 2√(x^2+z^2), 2√(x^2+y^2). Solving for x^2, y^2, z^2 from the given edges yields explicit values, enabling computation of volume V and surface area S. The inradius r of a tangential tetrahedron satisfies r = 3V/S. The symmetry puts the incenter at the origin, simplifying area calculations via cross products of edge vectors.

### Key Information Summary:
- Symmetric model: A = x + y + z, B = x − y − z, C = −x + y − z, D = −x − y + z with x ⟂ y ⟂ z.
- Edge relations:
  - 2√(y^2 + z^2) = √41 ⇒ y^2 + z^2 = 41/4
  - 2√(x^2 + z^2) = √80 ⇒ x^2 + z^2 = 20
  - 2√(x^2 + y^2) = √89 ⇒ x^2 + y^2 = 89/4
- Solving gives: x^2 = 16, y^2 = 25/4, z^2 = 4 ⇒ x=4, y=5/2, z=2.
- Volume: V = (8/3) x y z = (8/3)·4·(5/2)·2 = 160/3.
- Face area via cross product (e.g., for triangle ABC): |AB × AC| = 12√21 ⇒ area per face = 6√21 ⇒ total surface area S = 24√21.
- Inradius: r = 3V/S = 160/(24√21) = 20/(3√21) = 20√21/63.
- In m√n/p form: m=20, n=21 (squarefree), p=63, with gcd(m,p)=1.

C0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:
- Model the isosceles (disphenoid) tetrahedron with symmetric coordinates:
  A = (x, y, z), B = (x, −y, −z), C = (−x, y, −z), D = (−x, −y, z).
  Then opposite edges are equal in pairs with:
  AB^2 = 4(y^2 + z^2), AC^2 = 4(x^2 + z^2), BC^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2).
- From AB = √41, AC = √80, BC = √89:
  y^2 + z^2 = 41/4, x^2 + z^2 = 20, x^2 + y^2 = 89/4.
  Solving gives x^2 = 16, y^2 = 25/4, z^2 = 4, hence x = 4, y = 5/2, z = 2.
- Volume of this tetrahedron is V = (8/3)xyz = (8/3)·4·(5/2)·2 = 160/3.
- Area of face ABC: with AB = (0, −2y, −2z), AC = (−2x, 0, −2z),
  area(ABC) = (1/2)|AB × AC| = 2√(x^2y^2 + x^2z^2 + y^2z^2) = 2√(100 + 64 + 25) = 6√21.
  All four faces are congruent, so total surface area S = 4·6√21 = 24√21.
- Inradius r satisfies V = (1/3)rS, so r = 3V/S = 160/(24√21) = 20/(3√21) = 20√21/63.
  Here m = 20, n = 21 (squarefree), p = 63 with gcd(m, p) = 1.
  Therefore m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.

### Proof Structure:
1. Set up symmetric coordinates for a disphenoid so opposite edges are equal by construction.
2. Translate given edge lengths into equations for x^2, y^2, z^2 and solve.
3. Compute volume via determinant formula yielding V = (8/3)xyz.
4. Compute one face area using a cross product and multiply by 4 for total surface area.
5. Use r = 3V/S to find the inradius in simplest radical form.
6. Extract m, n, p and compute m + n + p = 104.

- Model as a disphenoid with vertices A=(x,y,z), B=(x,-y,-z), C=(-x,y,-z), D=(-x,-y,z).
- From edge equalities:
  - 2√(y^2+z^2) = √41 ⇒ y^2+z^2 = 41/4
  - 2√(x^2+z^2) = √80 ⇒ x^2+z^2 = 20
  - 2√(x^2+y^2) = √89 ⇒ x^2+y^2 = 89/4
- Solve: x^2=16, z^2=4, y^2=25/4.
- Volume: V = (8/3)xyz = (8/3)·4·(5/2)·2 = 160/3.
- One face area (e.g., ABC): (1/2)|AB×AC| = 2√(x^2y^2 + y^2z^2 + z^2x^2) = 2√(100+25+64) = 6√21.
- Total surface area: S = 4·6√21 = 24√21.
- Inradius: r = 3V/S = 3·(160/3)/(24√21) = 20/(3√21) = (20√21)/63.
- Thus m=20, n=21, p=63; gcd(m,p)=1 and n squarefree. Sum m+n+p = 20+21+63 = 104.

C0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis:
- A common pitfall is to assume a tangential tetrahedron always admits an “edge = sum of two vertex weights” representation (e.g., AB = a + b, etc.), analogous to tangential quadrilaterals. Applying this to an isosceles tetrahedron (opposite edges equal) incorrectly forces all four vertex weights equal, which would imply all six edges are equal—contradicting the given unequal edge lengths. This approach is not valid in 3D for tetrahedra.
- The correct symmetric model for an isosceles tetrahedron is to place vertices at A = x + y + z, B = x − y − z, C = −x + y − z, D = −x − y + z with x, y, z mutually orthogonal vectors of lengths a, b, c. Then opposite edges are equal with lengths:
  AB = 2√(b^2 + c^2), AC = 2√(a^2 + c^2), AD = 2√(a^2 + b^2).
  This model avoids the invalid edge-sum assumption.

### Corrections:
- From the given edges: AB = √41, AC = √80 = 4√5, AD = √89, we get:
  b^2 + c^2 = 41/4, a^2 + c^2 = 20, a^2 + b^2 = 89/4.
  Solving: b^2 − c^2 = 9/4 and a^2 − c^2 = 12 with b^2 + c^2 = 41/4 gives b^2 = 25/4, c^2 = 4, a^2 = 16 ⇒ a = 4, b = 5/2, c = 2.
- Volume: V = (8/3)abc = (8/3)(4)(5/2)(2) = 160/3.
- Area of one face ABC: using AB = −2(y + z), AC = −2(x + z),
  |(y + z) × (x + z)| = √(a^2b^2 + a^2c^2 + b^2c^2) = √(100 + 64 + 25) = √189 = 3√21.
  Area(ABC) = (1/2)|AB × AC| = (1/2)(4)(3√21) = 6√21.
  All four faces are congruent, so S = 4 · 6√21 = 24√21.
- Inradius: r = 3V/S = 3·(160/3)/(24√21) = 160/(24√21) = 20/(3√21) = (20√21)/63.
  Here m = 20, n = 21 (squarefree), p = 63, gcd(m, p) = 1.
- Final integer: m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.

C0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: The tetrahedron is a disphenoid with opposite edges equal. Using the symmetric model with orthogonal vectors x, y, z and vertices A = x + y + z, B = x − y − z, C = −x + y − z, D = −x − y + z, the given edge lengths yield:
- 2√(β^2 + γ^2) = √41 ⇒ β^2 + γ^2 = 41/4
- 2√(α^2 + γ^2) = √80 ⇒ α^2 + γ^2 = 20
- 2√(α^2 + β^2) = √89 ⇒ α^2 + β^2 = 89/4

Solving gives α^2 = 16, β^2 = 25/4, γ^2 = 4. The volume is V = (8/3)αβγ = (8/3)·4·(5/2)·2 = 160/3. Each face area is S_face = 2√((αβ)^2 + (βγ)^2 + (αγ)^2) = 2√(100 + 25 + 64) = 6√21, so total surface area S = 4·6√21 = 24√21. The inradius is r = 3V/S = 160/(24√21) = 20√21/63. Here m = 20, n = 21 (squarefree), p = 63 with gcd(m, p) = 1. Therefore, m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.
### Correctness Confirmation: All computations are consistent with the disphenoid model, areas verified via orthogonality, and a numeric check matches approximations. The final integer is 104.

We have a disphenoid (isosceles tetrahedron) with opposite edges equal: AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, BC=AD=√89. Such a tetrahedron admits an insphere; we must find its inradius r in the form m√n/p with n squarefree and gcd(m,p)=1, then output m+n+p as an integer. A symmetric coordinate model for disphenoids is A(x,y,z), B(x,-y,-z), C(-x,y,-z), D(-x,-y,z), giving opposite edge squares: AB^2=4(y^2+z^2), AC^2=4(x^2+z^2), AD^2=4(x^2+y^2). Solving yields x=4, y=5/2, z=2. The incenter is at the origin with inradius r = xyz / sqrt(x^2y^2 + x^2z^2 + y^2z^2) = 20/√189 = (20√21)/63, where gcd(20,63)=1 and 21 is squarefree.

C0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:
- A disphenoid (isosceles tetrahedron) with opposite equal edges can be modeled by vertices A=(x,y,z), B=(x,-y,-z), C=(-x,y,-z), D=(-x,-y,z).
- Given AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, AD=BC=√89, we have:
  - 2√(y^2+z^2)=√41 ⇒ y^2+z^2=41/4
  - 2√(x^2+z^2)=√80 ⇒ x^2+z^2=20
  - 2√(x^2+y^2)=√89 ⇒ x^2+y^2=89/4
- Solving yields z^2=4, y^2=25/4, x^2=16, so x=4, y=5/2, z=2.
- By symmetry, the incenter is at the origin. The plane ABC has normal n=(5,8,-10), equation 5x+8y-10z=20.
- Inradius r is the distance from the origin to this plane: r=|−20|/||n||=20/√189=20√21/63.
- Here m=20, n=21, p=63, with gcd(20,63)=1 and 21 squarefree.

Therefore, m+n+p=20+21+63=104.

### Proof Structure:
1. Use standard symmetric coordinates for a disphenoid to relate edge lengths to x, y, z.
2. Solve the system for x, y, z from the given opposite edge lengths.

4. Compute the inradius as the distance from the origin to that plane.
5. Express r in the form m√n/p with n squarefree and gcd(m,p)=1.

  2√(y^2+z^2)=√41, 2√(x^2+z^2)=√80, 2√(x^2+y^2)=√89.
- Solve:
  y^2+z^2=41/4, x^2+z^2=20, x^2+y^2=89/4 ⇒ z^2=4, x^2=16, y^2=25/4.
- One face plane (opposite (x,y,z)) has normal proportional to (5,8,10) and equation 5x+8y+10z = -20.
- Distance from origin to this plane (the inradius) r = |−20|/√(5^2+8^2+10^2) = 20/√189 = 20/(3√21) = 20√21/63.

C0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: 
- Recognize the tetrahedron is a disphenoid (isosceles tetrahedron) with opposite equal edges: u=√41, v=√80, w=√89.
- Use the standard coordinate model for a disphenoid with vertices at (±x, ±y, ±z), giving opposite edge lengths: 
  u = 2√(y^2+z^2), v = 2√(z^2+x^2), w = 2√(x^2+y^2).
- Solve:
  b+c = 41/4, c+a = 20, a+b = 89/4 → c=4, a=16, b=25/4, so x=4, y=5/2, z=2.
- Inradius for disphenoid: r = xyz / √(x^2y^2 + y^2z^2 + z^2x^2).
  Compute numerator: xyz = 4*(5/2)*2 = 20.
  Denominator: x^2y^2 + y^2z^2 + z^2x^2 = 100 + 25 + 64 = 189 = 9·21.
  So r = 20/√189 = 20/(3√21) = (20√21)/63.
