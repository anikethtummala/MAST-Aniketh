C0003 say to All: ### Context Analysis:
We seek the greatest 4-digit integer N such that replacing any one of its four digits by 1 yields a number divisible by 7. Writing N = Σ d_i·10^i (i=0 for units to 3 for thousands), the condition for each position i is:
N - d_i·10^i + 1·10^i ≡ 0 (mod 7) ⇒ N ≡ (d_i − 1)·10^i (mod 7).
Thus, (d_i − 1)·10^i ≡ c (mod 7) for the same constant c across all four i. Using 10^i mod 7 = [1, 3, 2, 6] for i = 0,1,2,3, with inverses [1, 5, 4, 6], we get:
d_i ≡ 1 + c·inv(10^i) (mod 7).
Each digit d_i must be in [0,9] (thousands digit nonzero), so for each i and c∈{0,…,6}, the allowed d_i are r or r+7 within [0,9], where r is the least nonnegative residue of 1 + c·inv(10^i) mod 7. We aim to choose c and corresponding digits to maximize N lexicographically (maximize thousands, then hundreds, tens, units), ensuring feasibility for all four positions. If any digit equals 1, the unchanged case implies N ≡ 0 (mod 7), but the general congruence framework already captures necessary compatibility.

After determining the maximal N, set Q = floor(N/1000) (the thousands digit) and R = N mod 1000 (last three digits), then compute Q + R.

### Key Information Summary:
- Condition per position i: N ≡ (d_i − 1)·10^i (mod 7), so a single c exists with (d_i − 1)·10^i ≡ c for all i.
- 10^i mod 7: [1, 3, 2, 6] for i = 0,1,2,3; inverses: [1, 5, 4, 6].
- Digit constraints: d_i ≡ 1 + c·inv(10^i) (mod 7), thus each d_i ∈ {r, r+7} ∩ [0,9], thousands digit ≥ 1.
- Strategy: Iterate c = 0..6, compute allowable digit sets for i=3,2,1,0; select the combination yielding the maximum 4-digit N; verify divisibility condition for all four replacements.
- Final computation: Q = thousands digit; R = last three digits; output the integer Q + R.

C0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:
- Let N be a 4-digit number with digits (a, b, c, d) corresponding to thousands, hundreds, tens, ones.
- The condition “changing any one digit to 1 yields a multiple of 7” means:
  For each position i ∈ {0,1,2,3}, the number N' = N + (1 − digit_i)·10^i is divisible by 7.
  Equivalently, N ≡ (digit_i − 1)·10^i (mod 7) for each i.
- Hence all four congruences must share the same residue modulo 7. Let this common residue be t (mod 7). Then for each i:
  digit_i ≡ 1 + t·(10^i)^{-1} (mod 7).
- Compute inverses modulo 7:
  10^0 ≡ 1 (inv 1), 10^1 ≡ 3 (inv 5), 10^2 ≡ 2 (inv 4), 10^3 ≡ 6 (inv 6).
  Thus the residues for digits are:
  d ≡ 1 + t (mod 7),
  c ≡ 1 + 5t (mod 7),
  b ≡ 1 + 4t (mod 7),
  a ≡ 1 + 6t (mod 7).
- Each decimal digit must be in {0,1,...,9}. For a residue r ∈ {0,...,6}, the only possible decimal digits matching r mod 7 are r or r+7 (when r+7 ≤ 9, i.e., r ≤ 2). The thousands digit a cannot be 0.
- To maximize N, choose:
  - A value of t ∈ {0,...,6} that maximizes the thousands digit a. For a residue r = (1 + 6t) mod 7, the maximal allowable thousands digit is:
    g(r) = r+7 if r ∈ {0,1,2}, otherwise g(r) = r (with the caveat that a ≠ 0; if r=0, pick 7).
  - Break ties by maximizing b, then c, then d similarly, choosing r_i+7 when possible (r_i ≤ 2), otherwise r_i.

### Proof Structure:
1. Necessity and sufficiency of a common residue:
   - From the condition for each i: N ≡ (digit_i − 1)·10^i (mod 7). Hence all RHS are equal modulo 7, so a common t exists. Conversely, if such t exists and digits satisfy the congruences, then for each i, N − (digit_i − 1)·10^i ≡ 0 (mod 7), so changing digit_i to 1 yields a multiple of 7.
2. Characterization of digits:
   - With inverses of 10^i modulo 7, each digit is constrained to a residue class modulo 7 determined by t. The only decimal representatives in [0,9] are r or r+7 (if ≤ 9), with the thousands digit not allowed to be 0.
3. Maximization strategy:
   - The leading digit determines the largest 4-digit N lex order. For each t, compute r3 = (1 + 6t) mod 7 and its maximal allowed decimal representative g(r3) as above. Choose the t giving the largest g(r3); this yields the largest possible thousands digit. Then choose the maximal allowed digits in the remaining positions accordingly.
4. Verification:
   - By construction, N satisfies N ≡ (digit_i − 1)·10^i ≡ t (mod 7) for all i, so changing any one digit to 1 yields a multiple of 7.
5. Final computation:
   - Once N is fixed, compute Q = floor(N/1000) and R = N mod 1000. Output Q + R.

C0004 say to All: ### Calculations:
Let N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. Mod 7 weights: 1000≡6, 100≡2, 10≡3, 1≡1.
Replacing each digit by 1 gives:
1) 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0
2) 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0
3) 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0
4) 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0  (mod 7)

From differences:
- b ≡ 3a + 5
- c ≡ 3b + 5 ≡ 2a + 6
- d ≡ 3c − 2 ≡ 6a + 2  (mod 7)

Plug into (4): 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 ⇒ a ≡ 5 (mod 7)
Thus (a,b,c,d) ≡ (5,6,2,4) (mod 7). Maximize digits:
a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 ⇒ N=5694.

Check: 1694=7·242, 5194=7·742, 5614=7·802, 5691=7·813, all divisible by 7.

Divide by 1000: Q=5, R=694 ⇒ Q+R=699.

### Numerical Results:

C0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:
Let N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d with digits a,b,c,d. Modulo 7, the place values are 1000≡6, 100≡2, 10≡3, 1≡1. The condition that replacing any one digit by 1 yields a multiple of 7 gives:
- a→1: 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0
- b→1: 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0
- c→1: 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0
- d→1: 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0

Subtracting the last from the first three yields:
d ≡ 6a + 2 ≡ 2b − 1 ≡ 3c − 2 (mod 7).

Thus the four conditions are equivalent to these three congruences plus one (e.g., 6a+2b+3c+1≡0). To maximize N, choose the largest possible thousands digit by testing residues r_a in order corresponding to a=9,8,7,6,5,...:

- r_a=2 (a=9) ⇒ r_d=0, r_b=4, r_c=3 gives 6r_a+2r_b+3r_c+1 ≡ 2 ≠ 0.
- r_a=1 (a=8) ⇒ r_d=1, r_b=1, r_c=1 gives 12 ≡ 5 ≠ 0.
- r_a=0 (a=7) ⇒ r_d=2, r_b=5, r_c=6 gives 29 ≡ 1 ≠ 0.
- r_a=6 (a=6) ⇒ r_d=3, r_b=2, r_c=4 gives 53 ≡ 4 ≠ 0.
- r_a=5 (a=5) ⇒ r_d=4, r_b=6, r_c=2 gives 49 ≡ 0 works.

With residues (a,b,c,d) ≡ (5,6,2,4) mod 7, the maximal digits in 0–9 matching these residues are a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4. Hence N=5694. Verify: 1694, 5194, 5614, 5691 are all divisible by 7. Then Q=5 and R=694, so Q+R=699.

### Proof Structure:
- Set up modulo-7 equations for the four “digit→1” replacements.
- Derive residue relations: d ≡ 6a+2 ≡ 2b−1 ≡ 3c−2 (mod 7).
- Impose one absolute condition: 6a+2b+3c+1 ≡ 0 (mod 7).
- Maximize thousands digit by testing residues r_a in descending digit order; only r_a=5 satisfies the absolute condition.
- Determine corresponding residues r_b=6, r_c=2, r_d=4 and choose maximal digits: (a,b,c,d)=(5,6,9,4).
- Confirm divisibility after replacements and compute Q+R: 5+694=699.

C0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: 
- No prior teammate solution was provided to audit. I verified the interpretation: for each position (thousands, hundreds, tens, ones), replacing that digit by 1 must yield a multiple of 7.
- Derived necessary congruences from pairwise differences of the “replaced” numbers:
  - d ≡ 2b − 1 (mod 7), d ≡ 3c − 2 (mod 7), d ≡ 6a − 5 (mod 7).
- Using M_d ≡ 0 (i.e., 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7) with the above, obtained 4a + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7) ⇒ a ≡ 5 (mod 7) ⇒ a = 5 (since a ∈ {1,…,9}).
- Then d ≡ 6a − 5 ≡ 4 (mod 7) ⇒ d = 4; b ≡ 3a + 5 ≡ 6 (mod 7) ⇒ b = 6; c ≡ 2a + 6 ≡ 2 (mod 7) ⇒ c ∈ {2,9}.
- Checked both candidates; the larger is N = 5694. Verified all four replacements by 1 yield multiples of 7.

### Corrections: 
- Greatest N is 5694. Then Q = 5, R = 694, so Q + R = 699.
- Final answer: 699

C0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: Derived congruences from the condition that replacing each digit by 1 yields a number divisible by 7. Using modular arithmetic with 1000 ≡ -1, 100 ≡ 2, and 10 ≡ 3 (mod 7), differences give:
- a + 2b ≡ 3
- 2b - 3c ≡ 6
- d ≡ 3c - 2 (mod 7)

Imposing one base equation (e.g., 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0) yields c ≡ 2 (mod 7), hence:
- a ≡ 5, b ≡ 6, c ≡ 2, d ≡ 4 (mod 7)

Within digit bounds, this forces a=5, b=6, d=4, and c ∈ {2,9}. To maximize N, pick c=9, giving N=5694.

Verification:
- 1694 = 7×242
- 5194 = 7×742
- 5614 = 7×802
- 5691 = 7×813
All divisible by 7. Therefore, N=5694 is valid and maximal.

Compute Q and R for N ÷ 1000: Q=5, R=694, so Q+R=699.

### Correctness Confirmation: The modular system was fully constrained by including a base equation, yielding a unique residue solution. Digit bounds enforce a=5, b=6, d=4, with c maximized as 9. All four replacements verify divisibility by 7. Final result Q+R=699 is correct.
