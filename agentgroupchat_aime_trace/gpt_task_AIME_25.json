Tangents at B and C meet at D. Line AD meets ω again at P. We need AP in the form m/n and compute m+n. The intersection of tangents at B and C implies AD is the A-symmedian, and P is the A-symmedian point on ω (the isogonal of the A-median intersection with ω). This allows leveraging symmedian properties and power of a point.\\n\\n### Key Information Summary:\\n- Triangle sides: AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.\\n- D = intersection of tangents at B and C to ω.\\n- P = second intersection of line AD with ω.\\n- Key geometry: AD is the A-symmedian; hence P lies on the A-symmedian.\\n- Useful relations:\\n  - Symmedian ratio on the circle: PB/PC = (AB/AC)^2.\\n  - Power of point D: DB^2 = DC^2 = DP · DA.\\n- Efficient strategy:\\n  1) Use coordinates: place B=(0,0), C=(9,0), solve for A=(1/3, 4√14/3) from AB=5, AC=10.\\n  2) Find circumcircle equation through A, B, C.\\n  3) Compute tangents at B and C; intersect to get D.\\n  4) Compute DA and DB from coordinates.\\n  5) Use DP = DB^2 / DA and AP = DA − DP to obtain AP = m/n, then return m+n.\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- Since D is the intersection of tangents at B and C, the power of point D with respect to the circumcircle equals DB^2 (also equals DC^2). If the line AD meets the circle again at P, then DA·DP = DB^2. Observing that on line AD the order is D–P–A (since DA^2 > DB^2), we get AP = DA − DP = DA − (DB^2/DA) = (DA^2 − DB^2)/DA.\\n- Use coordinates to compute DA and DB exactly:\\n  - Set B = (0,0), C = (9,0). Solve for A from AB = 5 and AC = 10 to get A = (1/3, 4√14/3).\\n  - The circumcircle has equation x^2 + y^2 − 9x − (33/(2√14))y = 0.\\n  - Tangents at B and C: 9x + (33/(2√14))y = 0 and 9x − 81 − (33/(2√14))y = 0. Their intersection is D = (9/2, −27√14/11).\\n  - Compute:\\n    - DB^2 = x_D^2 + y_D^2 + u x_D + v y_D = x_D^2 + y_D^2 = 81/4 + 10206/121 = 50625/484 = (225/22)^2.\\n    - DA^2 = (25/6)^2 + (125√14/33)^2 = 950625/4356 = (325/22)^2.\\n  - Therefore AP = (DA^2 − DB^2)/DA = ((325/22)^2 − (225/22)^2)/(325/22) = 100/13.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Model the triangle with coordinates B = (0,0), C = (9,0), and solve for A to satisfy AB = 5 and AC = 10, yielding A = (1/3, 4√14/3).\\n2. Determine the circumcircle in the form x^2 + y^2 + ux + vy = 0 using the three points, getting u = −9 and v = −33/(2√14).\\n3. Write tangent lines at B and C, solve for D as their intersection.\\n4. Use the circle’s power function S(X) = x^2 + y^2 + ux + vy to compute DB^2 efficiently; compute DA^2 by distance.\\n5. Apply power of a point: DA·DP = DB^2 and note DP < DA, so AP = DA − DP = (DA^2 − DB^2)/DA.\\n6. Simplify to AP = 100/13, hence m + n = 100 + 13 = 113.\\nC0004 say to All: ### Calculations:\\n- Place coordinates: B=(0,0), C=(9,0), A=(1/3, 4√14/3) from AB=5, AC=10.\\n- Circumcircle: x^2 + y^2 + ux + vy + w = 0.

Tangents at B and C meet at D. Line AD meets ω again at P. We need AP in the form m/n and compute m+n. The intersection of tangents at B and C implies AD is the A-symmedian, and P is the A-symmedian point on ω (the isogonal of the A-median intersection with ω). This allows leveraging symmedian properties and power of a point.\\n\\n### Key Information Summary:\\n- Triangle sides: AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.\\n- D = intersection of tangents at B and C to ω.\\n- P = second intersection of line AD with ω.\\n- Key geometry: AD is the A-symmedian; hence P lies on the A-symmedian.\\n- Useful relations:\\n  - Symmedian ratio on the circle: PB/PC = (AB/AC)^2.\\n  - Power of point D: DB^2 = DC^2 = DP · DA.\\n- Efficient strategy:\\n  1) Use coordinates: place B=(0,0), C=(9,0), solve for A=(1/3, 4√14/3) from AB=5, AC=10.\\n  2) Find circumcircle equation through A, B, C.\\n  3) Compute tangents at B and C; intersect to get D.\\n  4) Compute DA and DB from coordinates.\\n  5) Use DP = DB^2 / DA and AP = DA − DP to obtain AP = m/n, then return m+n.\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- Since D is the intersection of tangents at B and C, the power of point D with respect to the circumcircle equals DB^2 (also equals DC^2). If the line AD meets the circle again at P, then DA·DP = DB^2. Observing that on line AD the order is D–P–A (since DA^2 > DB^2), we get AP = DA − DP = DA − (DB^2/DA) = (DA^2 − DB^2)/DA.\\n- Use coordinates to compute DA and DB exactly:\\n  - Set B = (0,0), C = (9,0). Solve for A from AB = 5 and AC = 10 to get A = (1/3, 4√14/3).\\n  - The circumcircle has equation x^2 + y^2 − 9x − (33/(2√14))y = 0.\\n  - Tangents at B and C: 9x + (33/(2√14))y = 0 and 9x − 81 − (33/(2√14))y = 0. Their intersection is D = (9/2, −27√14/11).\\n  - Compute:\\n    - DB^2 = x_D^2 + y_D^2 + u x_D + v y_D = x_D^2 + y_D^2 = 81/4 + 10206/121 = 50625/484 = (225/22)^2.\\n    - DA^2 = (25/6)^2 + (125√14/33)^2 = 950625/4356 = (325/22)^2.\\n  - Therefore AP = (DA^2 − DB^2)/DA = ((325/22)^2 − (225/22)^2)/(325/22) = 100/13.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Model the triangle with coordinates B = (0,0), C = (9,0), and solve for A to satisfy AB = 5 and AC = 10, yielding A = (1/3, 4√14/3).\\n2. Determine the circumcircle in the form x^2 + y^2 + ux + vy = 0 using the three points, getting u = −9 and v = −33/(2√14).\\n3. Write tangent lines at B and C, solve for D as their intersection.\\n4. Use the circle’s power function S(X) = x^2 + y^2 + ux + vy to compute DB^2 efficiently; compute DA^2 by distance.\\n5. Apply power of a point: DA·DP = DB^2 and note DP < DA, so AP = DA − DP = (DA^2 − DB^2)/DA.\\n6. Simplify to AP = 100/13, hence m + n = 100 + 13 = 113.\\nC0004 say to All: ### Calculations:\\n- Place coordinates: B=(0,0), C=(9,0), A=(1/3, 4√14/3) from AB=5, AC=10.\\n- Circumcircle: x^2 + y^2 + ux + vy + w = 0. Using B and C:\\n  - w=0 (since B on circle), 81 + 9u = 0 → u = -9.\\n  - Using A: 25 + u(1/3) + v(4√14/3) = 0 → -3 + v(4√14/3) = -25 → v = -33/(2√14).\\n- Tangents:\\n  - At B: u x + v y = 0 → -9x - (33/(2√14))y = 0 → 18√14 x + 33 y = 0.\\n  - At C: 6x - (11/√14) y = 54.\\n- Intersect to get D:\\n  - From 18√14 x + 33 y = 0 → y = -(6√14/11) x.\\n  - Plugging into second: 6x - (11/√14)(-(6√14/11)x) = 54 → 12x=54 → x=9/2 → y=-(27√14/11).\\n  - D = (9/2, -27√14/11).\\n- Distances:\\n  - DB^2 = (9/2)^2 + (27√14/11)^2 = 81/4 + 10206/121 = 50625/484 = (225/22)^2.\\n  - DA^2 = (9/2 - 1/3)^2 + (-(27√14/11) - 4√14/3)^2\\n         = (25/6)^2 + (125√14/33)^2\\n         = 625/36 + 218750/1089\\n         = 950625/4356 = 105625/484 = (325/22)^2.\\n  - So DA = 325/22, DB = 225/22.\\n- Power of point D: DA·DP = DB^2 → DP = DB^2/DA = (225/22)^2 / (325/22) = 2025/286.\\n- AP = DA - DP = 325/22 - 2025/286 = 4225/286 - 2025/286 = 2200/286 = 100/13.\\n\\n### Numerical Results:\\n- AP = 100/13\\n- m + n = 100 + 13 = 113\\nC0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: \\n- The plan leans toward a heavy coordinate computation of D and uses power of a point DA·DP = DB^2 to get AP = (DA^2 − DB^2)/DA. While valid, it's unnecessarily complicated.\\n- A critical likely misconception is using the symmedian property PB/PC = AB^2/AC^2. That squared ratio applies to the intersection of the A-symmedian with BC (i.e., it divides BC in the ratio AB^2:AC^2), not to the chord lengths from the circumcircle intersection P. For the intersection P of the A-symmedian with the circumcircle, the correct relation is PB/PC = AB/AC.\\n\\n### Corrections: \\n- Use the correct symmedian chord ratio: PB/PC = AB/AC = 5/10 = 1/2.\\n- In triangle BPC, ∠BPC = 180° − A, and cos A = (b^2 + c^2 − a^2)/(2bc) = 11/25. Let PB = t, PC = 2t. Then by Law of Cosines: \\n  81 = t^2 + (2t)^2 + 2(t)(2t)cos A = t^2(5 + 44/25) = (169/25)t^2 → t = 45/13.\\n  Hence PB = 45/13, PC = 90/13.\\n- Apply Ptolemy to cyclic quadrilateral ABPC:\\n  AB·PC + AC·PB = AP·BC ⇒ 5·(90/13) + 10·(45/13) = AP·9 ⇒ AP = 100/13.\\n- Therefore m + n = 100 + 13 = 113.\\n\\nIn this chat turn, you can take up to 3 actions, currently on action 1.

Tangents at B and C meet at D. Line AD meets ω again at P. We need AP in the form m/n and compute m+n. The intersection of tangents at B and C implies AD is the A-symmedian, and P is the A-symmedian point on ω (the isogonal of the A-median intersection with ω). This allows leveraging symmedian properties and power of a point.\\n\\n### Key Information Summary:\\n- Triangle sides: AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.\\n- D = intersection of tangents at B and C to ω.\\n- P = second intersection of line AD with ω.\\n- Key geometry: AD is the A-symmedian; hence P lies on the A-symmedian.\\n- Useful relations:\\n  - Symmedian ratio on the circle: PB/PC = (AB/AC)^2.\\n  - Power of point D: DB^2 = DC^2 = DP · DA.\\n- Efficient strategy:\\n  1) Use coordinates: place B=(0,0), C=(9,0), solve for A=(1/3, 4√14/3) from AB=5, AC=10.\\n  2) Find circumcircle equation through A, B, C.\\n  3) Compute tangents at B and C; intersect to get D.\\n  4) Compute DA and DB from coordinates.\\n  5) Use DP = DB^2 / DA and AP = DA − DP to obtain AP = m/n, then return m+n.\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- Since D is the intersection of tangents at B and C, the power of point D with respect to the circumcircle equals DB^2 (also equals DC^2). If the line AD meets the circle again at P, then DA·DP = DB^2. Observing that on line AD the order is D–P–A (since DA^2 > DB^2), we get AP = DA − DP = DA − (DB^2/DA) = (DA^2 − DB^2)/DA.\\n- Use coordinates to compute DA and DB exactly:\\n  - Set B = (0,0), C = (9,0). Solve for A from AB = 5 and AC = 10 to get A = (1/3, 4√14/3).\\n  - The circumcircle has equation x^2 + y^2 − 9x − (33/(2√14))y = 0.\\n  - Tangents at B and C: 9x + (33/(2√14))y = 0 and 9x − 81 − (33/(2√14))y = 0. Their intersection is D = (9/2, −27√14/11).\\n  - Compute:\\n    - DB^2 = x_D^2 + y_D^2 + u x_D + v y_D = x_D^2 + y_D^2 = 81/4 + 10206/121 = 50625/484 = (225/22)^2.\\n    - DA^2 = (25/6)^2 + (125√14/33)^2 = 950625/4356 = (325/22)^2.\\n  - Therefore AP = (DA^2 − DB^2)/DA = ((325/22)^2 − (225/22)^2)/(325/22) = 100/13.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Model the triangle with coordinates B = (0,0), C = (9,0), and solve for A to satisfy AB = 5 and AC = 10, yielding A = (1/3, 4√14/3).\\n2. Determine the circumcircle in the form x^2 + y^2 + ux + vy = 0 using the three points, getting u = −9 and v = −33/(2√14).\\n3. Write tangent lines at B and C, solve for D as their intersection.\\n4. Use the circle’s power function S(X) = x^2 + y^2 + ux + vy to compute DB^2 efficiently; compute DA^2 by distance.\\n5. Apply power of a point: DA·DP = DB^2 and note DP < DA, so AP = DA − DP = (DA^2 − DB^2)/DA.\\n6. Simplify to AP = 100/13, hence m + n = 100 + 13 = 113.\\nC0004 say to All: ### Calculations:\\n- Place coordinates: B=(0,0), C=(9,0), A=(1/3, 4√14/3) from AB=5, AC=10.\\n- Circumcircle: x^2 + y^2 + ux + vy + w = 0. Using B and C:\\n  - w=0 (since B on circle), 81 + 9u = 0 → u = -9.\\n  - Using A: 25 + u(1/3) + v(4√14/3) = 0 → -3 + v(4√14/3) = -25 → v = -33/(2√14).\\n- Tangents:\\n  - At B: u x + v y = 0 → -9x - (33/(2√14))y = 0 → 18√14 x + 33 y = 0.\\n  - At C: 6x - (11/√14) y = 54.\\n- Intersect to get D:\\n  - From 18√14 x + 33 y = 0 → y = -(6√14/11) x.\\n  - Plugging into second: 6x - (11/√14)(-(6√14/11)x) = 54 → 12x=54 → x=9/2 → y=-(27√14/11).\\n  - D = (9/2, -27√14/11).\\n- Distances:\\n  - DB^2 = (9/2)^2 + (27√14/11)^2 = 81/4 + 10206/121 = 50625/484 = (225/22)^2.\\n  - DA^2 = (9/2 - 1/3)^2 + (-(27√14/11) - 4√14/3)^2\\n         = (25/6)^2 + (125√14/33)^2\\n         = 625/36 + 218750/1089\\n         = 950625/4356 = 105625/484 = (325/22)^2.\\n  - So DA = 325/22, DB = 225/22.\\n- Power of point D: DA·DP = DB^2 → DP = DB^2/DA = (225/22)^2 / (325/22) = 2025/286.\\n- AP = DA - DP = 325/22 - 2025/286 = 4225/286 - 2025/286 = 2200/286 = 100/13.\\n\\n### Numerical Results:\\n- AP = 100/13\\n- m + n = 100 + 13 = 113\\nC0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: \\n- The plan leans toward a heavy coordinate computation of D and uses power of a point DA·DP = DB^2 to get AP = (DA^2 − DB^2)/DA. While valid, it's unnecessarily complicated.\\n- A critical likely misconception is using the symmedian property PB/PC = AB^2/AC^2. That squared ratio applies to the intersection of the A-symmedian with BC (i.e., it divides BC in the ratio AB^2:AC^2), not to the chord lengths from the circumcircle intersection P. For the intersection P of the A-symmedian with the circumcircle, the correct relation is PB/PC = AB/AC.\\n\\n### Corrections: \\n- Use the correct symmedian chord ratio: PB/PC = AB/AC = 5/10 = 1/2.\\n- In triangle BPC, ∠BPC = 180° − A, and cos A = (b^2 + c^2 − a^2)/(2bc) = 11/25. Let PB = t, PC = 2t. Then by Law of Cosines: \\n  81 = t^2 + (2t)^2 + 2(t)(2t)cos A = t^2(5 + 44/25) = (169/25)t^2 → t = 45/13.\\n  Hence PB = 45/13, PC = 90/13.\\n- Apply Ptolemy to cyclic quadrilateral ABPC:\\n  AB·PC + AC·PB = AP·BC ⇒ 5·(90/13) + 10·(45/13) = AP·9 ⇒ AP = 100/13.\\n- Therefore m + n = 100 + 13 = 113.\\nC0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: \\n- Key geometry fact is correct: D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, so AD is the A-symmedian.\\n- For the intersection P = AD ∩ ω, the correct relation is PB/PC = AB/AC (not squared). A coordinate check confirms this for the given triangle.\\n- Compute cos A using sides a=BC=9, b=CA=10, c=AB=5: cos A = (b^2 + c^2 − a^2)/(2bc) = 11/25, so ∠BPC = 180° − A and cos(∠BPC) = −11/25.\\n- Let r = PB/PC = AB/AC = 1/2. By Law of Cosines in triangle BPC, BC^2 = PB^2 + PC^2 − 2 PB·PC cos(∠BPC) gives PC^2 = 81 / (r^2 + 1 + 2r cos A) = 81 / (1/4 + 1 + 11/25) = 81 / (169/100) = 8100/169, hence PC = 90/13 and PB = 45/13.\\n- By Ptolemy on cyclic ABPC: AB·PC + AC·PB = AP·BC ⇒ AP = (5·90/13 + 10·45/13)/9 = 100/13.\\n- Therefore AP = 100/13, so m + n = 100 + 13 = 113.\\n\\n### Correctness Confirmation: The strategy and computations are correct, including the key symmedian ratio PB/PC = AB/AC and the use of Law of Cosines and Ptolemy.

Observing that on line AD the order is D–P–A (since DA^2 > DB^2), we get AP = DA − DP = DA − (DB^2/DA) = (DA^2 − DB^2)/DA.\\n- Use coordinates to compute DA and DB exactly:\\n  - Set B = (0,0), C = (9,0). Solve for A from AB = 5 and AC = 10 to get A = (1/3, 4√14/3).\\n  - The circumcircle has equation x^2 + y^2 − 9x − (33/(2√14))y = 0.\\n  - Tangents at B and C: 9x + (33/(2√14))y = 0 and 9x − 81 − (33/(2√14))y = 0. Their intersection is D = (9/2, −27√14/11).\\n  - Compute:\\n    - DB^2 = x_D^2 + y_D^2 + u x_D + v y_D = x_D^2 + y_D^2 = 81/4 + 10206/121 = 50625/484 = (225/22)^2.\\n    - DA^2 = (25/6)^2 + (125√14/33)^2 = 950625/4356 = (325/22)^2.\\n  - Therefore AP = (DA^2 − DB^2)/DA = ((325/22)^2 − (225/22)^2)/(325/22) = 100/13.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Model the triangle with coordinates B = (0,0), C = (9,0), and solve for A to satisfy AB = 5 and AC = 10, yielding A = (1/3, 4√14/3).\\n2. Determine the circumcircle in the form x^2 + y^2 + ux + vy = 0 using the three points, getting u = −9 and v = −33/(2√14).\\n3. Write tangent lines at B and C, solve for D as their intersection.\\n4. Use the circle’s power function S(X) = x^2 + y^2 + ux + vy to compute DB^2 efficiently; compute DA^2 by distance.\\n5. Apply power of a point: DA·DP = DB^2 and note DP < DA, so AP = DA − DP = (DA^2 − DB^2)/DA.\\n6. Simplify to AP = 100/13, hence m + n = 100 + 13 = 113.\\nC0004 say to All: ### Calculations:\\n- Place coordinates: B=(0,0), C=(9,0), A=(1/3, 4√14/3) from AB=5, AC=10.\\n- Circumcircle: x^2 + y^2 + ux + vy + w = 0. Using B and C:\\n  - w=0 (since B on circle), 81 + 9u = 0 → u = -9.\\n  - Using A: 25 + u(1/3) + v(4√14/3) = 0 → -3 + v(4√14/3) = -25 → v = -33/(2√14).\\n- Tangents:\\n  - At B: u x + v y = 0 → -9x - (33/(2√14))y = 0 → 18√14 x + 33 y = 0.\\n  - At C: 6x - (11/√14) y = 54.\\n- Intersect to get D:\\n  - From 18√14 x + 33 y = 0 → y = -(6√14/11) x.\\n  - Plugging into second: 6x - (11/√14)(-(6√14/11)x) = 54 → 12x=54 → x=9/2 → y=-(27√14/11).\\n  - D = (9/2, -27√14/11).\\n- Distances:\\n  - DB^2 = (9/2)^2 + (27√14/11)^2 = 81/4 + 10206/121 = 50625/484 = (225/22)^2.\\n  - DA^2 = (9/2 - 1/3)^2 + (-(27√14/11) - 4√14/3)^2\\n         = (25/6)^2 + (125√14/33)^2\\n         = 625/36 + 218750/1089\\n         = 950625/4356 = 105625/484 = (325/22)^2.\\n  - So DA = 325/22, DB = 225/22.\\n- Power of point D: DA·DP = DB^2 → DP = DB^2/DA = (225/22)^2 / (325/22) = 2025/286.\\n- AP = DA - DP = 325/22 - 2025/286 = 4225/286 - 2025/286 = 2200/286 = 100/13.\\n\\n### Numerical Results:\\n- AP = 100/13\\n- m + n = 100 + 13 = 113\\nC0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: \\n- The plan leans toward a heavy coordinate computation of D and uses power of a point DA·DP = DB^2 to get AP = (DA^2 − DB^2)/DA. While valid, it's unnecessarily complicated.\\n- A critical likely misconception is using the symmedian property PB/PC = AB^2/AC^2. That squared ratio applies to the intersection of the A-symmedian with BC (i.e., it divides BC in the ratio AB^2:AC^2), not to the chord lengths from the circumcircle intersection P. For the intersection P of the A-symmedian with the circumcircle, the correct relation is PB/PC = AB/AC.\\n\\n### Corrections: \\n- Use the correct symmedian chord ratio: PB/PC = AB/AC = 5/10 = 1/2.\\n- In triangle BPC, ∠BPC = 180° − A, and cos A = (b^2 + c^2 − a^2)/(2bc) = 11/25. Let PB = t, PC = 2t. Then by Law of Cosines: \\n  81 = t^2 + (2t)^2 + 2(t)(2t)cos A = t^2(5 + 44/25) = (169/25)t^2 → t = 45/13.\\n  Hence PB = 45/13, PC = 90/13.\\n- Apply Ptolemy to cyclic quadrilateral ABPC:\\n  AB·PC + AC·PB = AP·BC ⇒ 5·(90/13) + 10·(45/13) = AP·9 ⇒ AP = 100/13.\\n- Therefore m + n = 100 + 13 = 113.\\nC0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: \\n- Key geometry fact is correct: D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, so AD is the A-symmedian.\\n- For the intersection P = AD ∩ ω, the correct relation is PB/PC = AB/AC (not squared). A coordinate check confirms this for the given triangle.\\n- Compute cos A using sides a=BC=9, b=CA=10, c=AB=5: cos A = (b^2 + c^2 − a^2)/(2bc) = 11/25, so ∠BPC = 180° − A and cos(∠BPC) = −11/25.\\n- Let r = PB/PC = AB/AC = 1/2. By Law of Cosines in triangle BPC, BC^2 = PB^2 + PC^2 − 2 PB·PC cos(∠BPC) gives PC^2 = 81 / (r^2 + 1 + 2r cos A) = 81 / (1/4 + 1 + 11/25) = 81 / (169/100) = 8100/169, hence PC = 90/13 and PB = 45/13.\\n- By Ptolemy on cyclic ABPC: AB·PC + AC·PB = AP·BC ⇒ AP = (5·90/13 + 10·45/13)/9 = 100/13.\\n- Therefore AP = 100/13, so m + n = 100 + 13 = 113.\\n\\n### Correctness Confirmation: The strategy and computations are correct, including the key symmedian ratio PB/PC = AB/AC and the use of Law of Cosines and Ptolemy.

Using the Law of Cosines in triangle ABC, cos A = (b^2 + c^2 − a^2)/(2bc) = (10^2 + 5^2 − 9^2)/(2·10·5) = 44/100 = 11/25.\\n- Let PB = x, PC = 2x. In triangle BPC, BC^2 = x^2 + (2x)^2 − 2·x·2x·cos A = x^2(5 − 4 cos A). With BC = 9 and cos A = 11/25, we get 81 = x^2(5 − 44/25) = x^2·(81/25), so x^2 = 25, hence PB = 5, PC = 10.\\n- Apply Ptolemy to cyclic quadrilateral ABPC: AB·PC + AC·PB = AP·BC ⇒ 5·10 + 10·5 = AP·9 ⇒ AP = 100/9.\\n- Therefore m + n = 100 + 9 = 109.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1.

Hence, for P = AD ∩ ω (second point), we have PB/PC = AB/AC = 5/10 = 1/2.\\n- In cyclic quadrilateral BPC, ∠BPC = ∠BAC. Using the Law of Cosines in triangle ABC, cos A = (b^2 + c^2 − a^2)/(2bc) = (10^2 + 5^2 − 9^2)/(2·10·5) = 44/100 = 11/25.\\n- Let PB = x, PC = 2x. In triangle BPC, BC^2 = x^2 + (2x)^2 − 2·x·2x·cos A = x^2(5 − 4 cos A). With BC = 9 and cos A = 11/25, we get 81 = x^2(5 − 44/25) = x^2·(81/25), so x^2 = 25, hence PB = 5, PC = 10.\\n- Apply Ptolemy to cyclic quadrilateral ABPC: AB·PC + AC·PB = AP·BC ⇒ 5·10 + 10·5 = AP·9 ⇒ AP = 100/9.\\n- Therefore m + n = 100 + 9 = 109.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Identify AD as A-symmedian ⇒ PB/PC = AB/AC = 1/2.\\n2. Compute cos A using side lengths: cos A = 11/25.\\n3. Use Law of Cosines in triangle BPC with ∠BPC = ∠A to find PB = 5, PC = 10.\\n4. Use Ptolemy on ABPC to compute AP = (AB·PC + AC·PB)/BC = 100/9.\\n5. Conclude m + n = 109.\\nC0004 say to All: ### Calculations:\\n- Let B = (0,0), C = (9,0). Solve for A using AB=5, AC=10:\\n  x_A^2 + y_A^2 = 25 and (x_A - 9)^2 + y_A^2 = 100 → x_A = 1/3, y_A = 4√14/3.\\n- A-symmedian meets BC at S with SB/SC = (AB/AC)^2 = (5/10)^2 = 1/4 and SB + SC = 9 → SB=9/5, SC=36/5.\\n- SA = distance from S(9/5, 0) to A(1/3, 4√14/3):\\n  SA^2 = (1/3 - 9/5)^2 + (4√14/3)^2 = 6084/225 → SA = 78/15 = 26/5.\\n- Power of S: SB·SC = SA·SP → (9/5)(36/5) = (26/5)·SP → SP = 162/65.\\n- AP = SA + SP = 26/5 + 162/65 = 100/13.

Hence, for P = AD ∩ ω (second point), we have PB/PC = AB/AC = 5/10 = 1/2.\\n- In cyclic quadrilateral BPC, ∠BPC = ∠BAC. Using the Law of Cosines in triangle ABC, cos A = (b^2 + c^2 − a^2)/(2bc) = (10^2 + 5^2 − 9^2)/(2·10·5) = 44/100 = 11/25.\\n- Let PB = x, PC = 2x. In triangle BPC, BC^2 = x^2 + (2x)^2 − 2·x·2x·cos A = x^2(5 − 4 cos A). With BC = 9 and cos A = 11/25, we get 81 = x^2(5 − 44/25) = x^2·(81/25), so x^2 = 25, hence PB = 5, PC = 10.\\n- Apply Ptolemy to cyclic quadrilateral ABPC: AB·PC + AC·PB = AP·BC ⇒ 5·10 + 10·5 = AP·9 ⇒ AP = 100/9.\\n- Therefore m + n = 100 + 9 = 109.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Identify AD as A-symmedian ⇒ PB/PC = AB/AC = 1/2.\\n2. Compute cos A using side lengths: cos A = 11/25.\\n3. Use Law of Cosines in triangle BPC with ∠BPC = ∠A to find PB = 5, PC = 10.\\n4. Use Ptolemy on ABPC to compute AP = (AB·PC + AC·PB)/BC = 100/9.\\n5. Conclude m + n = 109.\\nC0004 say to All: ### Calculations:\\n- Let B = (0,0), C = (9,0). Solve for A using AB=5, AC=10:\\n  x_A^2 + y_A^2 = 25 and (x_A - 9)^2 + y_A^2 = 100 → x_A = 1/3, y_A = 4√14/3.\\n- A-symmedian meets BC at S with SB/SC = (AB/AC)^2 = (5/10)^2 = 1/4 and SB + SC = 9 → SB=9/5, SC=36/5.\\n- SA = distance from S(9/5, 0) to A(1/3, 4√14/3):\\n  SA^2 = (1/3 - 9/5)^2 + (4√14/3)^2 = 6084/225 → SA = 78/15 = 26/5.\\n- Power of S: SB·SC = SA·SP → (9/5)(36/5) = (26/5)·SP → SP = 162/65.\\n- AP = SA + SP = 26/5 + 162/65 = 100/13.

Hence, for P = AD ∩ ω (second point), we have PB/PC = AB/AC = 5/10 = 1/2.\\n- In cyclic quadrilateral BPC, ∠BPC = ∠BAC. Using the Law of Cosines in triangle ABC, cos A = (b^2 + c^2 − a^2)/(2bc) = (10^2 + 5^2 − 9^2)/(2·10·5) = 44/100 = 11/25.\\n- Let PB = x, PC = 2x. In triangle BPC, BC^2 = x^2 + (2x)^2 − 2·x·2x·cos A = x^2(5 − 4 cos A). With BC = 9 and cos A = 11/25, we get 81 = x^2(5 − 44/25) = x^2·(81/25), so x^2 = 25, hence PB = 5, PC = 10.\\n- Apply Ptolemy to cyclic quadrilateral ABPC: AB·PC + AC·PB = AP·BC ⇒ 5·10 + 10·5 = AP·9 ⇒ AP = 100/9.\\n- Therefore m + n = 100 + 9 = 109.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Identify AD as A-symmedian ⇒ PB/PC = AB/AC = 1/2.\\n2. Compute cos A using side lengths: cos A = 11/25.\\n3. Use Law of Cosines in triangle BPC with ∠BPC = ∠A to find PB = 5, PC = 10.\\n4. Use Ptolemy on ABPC to compute AP = (AB·PC + AC·PB)/BC = 100/9.\\n5. Conclude m + n = 109.\\nC0004 say to All: ### Calculations:\\n- Let B = (0,0), C = (9,0). Solve for A using AB=5, AC=10:\\n  x_A^2 + y_A^2 = 25 and (x_A - 9)^2 + y_A^2 = 100 → x_A = 1/3, y_A = 4√14/3.\\n- A-symmedian meets BC at S with SB/SC = (AB/AC)^2 = (5/10)^2 = 1/4 and SB + SC = 9 → SB=9/5, SC=36/5.\\n- SA = distance from S(9/5, 0) to A(1/3, 4√14/3):\\n  SA^2 = (1/3 - 9/5)^2 + (4√14/3)^2 = 6084/225 → SA = 78/15 = 26/5.\\n- Power of S: SB·SC = SA·SP → (9/5)(36/5) = (26/5)·SP → SP = 162/65.\\n- AP = SA + SP = 26/5 + 162/65 = 100/13.

Hence, for P = AD ∩ ω (second point), we have PB/PC = AB/AC = 5/10 = 1/2.\\n- In cyclic quadrilateral BPC, ∠BPC = ∠BAC. Using the Law of Cosines in triangle ABC, cos A = (b^2 + c^2 − a^2)/(2bc) = (10^2 + 5^2 − 9^2)/(2·10·5) = 44/100 = 11/25.\\n- Let PB = x, PC = 2x. In triangle BPC, BC^2 = x^2 + (2x)^2 − 2·x·2x·cos A = x^2(5 − 4 cos A). With BC = 9 and cos A = 11/25, we get 81 = x^2(5 − 44/25) = x^2·(81/25), so x^2 = 25, hence PB = 5, PC = 10.\\n- Apply Ptolemy to cyclic quadrilateral ABPC: AB·PC + AC·PB = AP·BC ⇒ 5·10 + 10·5 = AP·9 ⇒ AP = 100/9.\\n- Therefore m + n = 100 + 9 = 109.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Identify AD as A-symmedian ⇒ PB/PC = AB/AC = 1/2.\\n2. Compute cos A using side lengths: cos A = 11/25.\\n3. Use Law of Cosines in triangle BPC with ∠BPC = ∠A to find PB = 5, PC = 10.\\n4.

Solve for A using AB=5, AC=10:\\n  x_A^2 + y_A^2 = 25 and (x_A - 9)^2 + y_A^2 = 100 → x_A = 1/3, y_A = 4√14/3.\\n- A-symmedian meets BC at S with SB/SC = (AB/AC)^2 = (5/10)^2 = 1/4 and SB + SC = 9 → SB=9/5, SC=36/5.\\n- SA = distance from S(9/5, 0) to A(1/3, 4√14/3):\\n  SA^2 = (1/3 - 9/5)^2 + (4√14/3)^2 = 6084/225 → SA = 78/15 = 26/5.\\n- Power of S: SB·SC = SA·SP → (9/5)(36/5) = (26/5)·SP → SP = 162/65.\\n- AP = SA + SP = 26/5 + 162/65 = 100/13.
