Such a tetrahedron admits a symmetric coordinate model using three mutually orthogonal vectors x, y, z, placing vertices at A = x + y + z, B = x − y − z, C = −x + y − z, D = −x − y + z. Opposite edge lengths then correspond to 2√(y^2+z^2), 2√(x^2+z^2), 2√(x^2+y^2). Solving for x^2, y^2, z^2 from the given edges yields explicit values, enabling computation of volume V and surface area S. The inradius r of a tangential tetrahedron satisfies r = 3V/S. The symmetry puts the incenter at the origin, simplifying area calculations via cross products of edge vectors.\\n\\n### Key Information Summary:\\n- Symmetric model: A = x + y + z, B = x − y − z, C = −x + y − z, D = −x − y + z with x ⟂ y ⟂ z.\\n- Edge relations:\\n  - 2√(y^2 + z^2) = √41 ⇒ y^2 + z^2 = 41/4\\n  - 2√(x^2 + z^2) = √80 ⇒ x^2 + z^2 = 20\\n  - 2√(x^2 + y^2) = √89 ⇒ x^2 + y^2 = 89/4\\n- Solving gives: x^2 = 16, y^2 = 25/4, z^2 = 4 ⇒ x=4, y=5/2, z=2.\\n- Volume: V = (8/3) x y z = (8/3)·4·(5/2)·2 = 160/3.\\n- Face area via cross product (e.g., for triangle ABC): |AB × AC| = 12√21 ⇒ area per face = 6√21 ⇒ total surface area S = 24√21.\\n- Inradius: r = 3V/S = 160/(24√21) = 20/(3√21) = 20√21/63.\\n- In m√n/p form: m=20, n=21 (squarefree), p=63, with gcd(m,p)=1.\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- Model the isosceles (disphenoid) tetrahedron with symmetric coordinates:\\n  A = (x, y, z), B = (x, −y, −z), C = (−x, y, −z), D = (−x, −y, z).\\n  Then opposite edges are equal in pairs with:\\n  AB^2 = 4(y^2 + z^2), AC^2 = 4(x^2 + z^2), BC^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2).\\n- From AB = √41, AC = √80, BC = √89:\\n  y^2 + z^2 = 41/4, x^2 + z^2 = 20, x^2 + y^2 = 89/4.\\n  Solving gives x^2 = 16, y^2 = 25/4, z^2 = 4, hence x = 4, y = 5/2, z = 2.\\n- Volume of this tetrahedron is V = (8/3)xyz = (8/3)·4·(5/2)·2 = 160/3.\\n- Area of face ABC: with AB = (0, −2y, −2z), AC = (−2x, 0, −2z),\\n  area(ABC) = (1/2)|AB × AC| = 2√(x^2y^2 + x^2z^2 + y^2z^2) = 2√(100 + 64 + 25) = 6√21.\\n  All four faces are congruent, so total surface area S = 4·6√21 = 24√21.\\n- Inradius r satisfies V = (1/3)rS, so r = 3V/S = 160/(24√21) = 20/(3√21) = 20√21/63.\\n  Here m = 20, n = 21 (squarefree), p = 63 with gcd(m, p) = 1.\\n  Therefore m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1.

Such a tetrahedron admits a symmetric coordinate model using three mutually orthogonal vectors x, y, z, placing vertices at A = x + y + z, B = x − y − z, C = −x + y − z, D = −x − y + z. Opposite edge lengths then correspond to 2√(y^2+z^2), 2√(x^2+z^2), 2√(x^2+y^2). Solving for x^2, y^2, z^2 from the given edges yields explicit values, enabling computation of volume V and surface area S. The inradius r of a tangential tetrahedron satisfies r = 3V/S. The symmetry puts the incenter at the origin, simplifying area calculations via cross products of edge vectors.\\n\\n### Key Information Summary:\\n- Symmetric model: A = x + y + z, B = x − y − z, C = −x + y − z, D = −x − y + z with x ⟂ y ⟂ z.\\n- Edge relations:\\n  - 2√(y^2 + z^2) = √41 ⇒ y^2 + z^2 = 41/4\\n  - 2√(x^2 + z^2) = √80 ⇒ x^2 + z^2 = 20\\n  - 2√(x^2 + y^2) = √89 ⇒ x^2 + y^2 = 89/4\\n- Solving gives: x^2 = 16, y^2 = 25/4, z^2 = 4 ⇒ x=4, y=5/2, z=2.\\n- Volume: V = (8/3) x y z = (8/3)·4·(5/2)·2 = 160/3.\\n- Face area via cross product (e.g., for triangle ABC): |AB × AC| = 12√21 ⇒ area per face = 6√21 ⇒ total surface area S = 24√21.\\n- Inradius: r = 3V/S = 160/(24√21) = 20/(3√21) = 20√21/63.\\n- In m√n/p form: m=20, n=21 (squarefree), p=63, with gcd(m,p)=1.\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- Model the isosceles (disphenoid) tetrahedron with symmetric coordinates:\\n  A = (x, y, z), B = (x, −y, −z), C = (−x, y, −z), D = (−x, −y, z).\\n  Then opposite edges are equal in pairs with:\\n  AB^2 = 4(y^2 + z^2), AC^2 = 4(x^2 + z^2), BC^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2).\\n- From AB = √41, AC = √80, BC = √89:\\n  y^2 + z^2 = 41/4, x^2 + z^2 = 20, x^2 + y^2 = 89/4.\\n  Solving gives x^2 = 16, y^2 = 25/4, z^2 = 4, hence x = 4, y = 5/2, z = 2.\\n- Volume of this tetrahedron is V = (8/3)xyz = (8/3)·4·(5/2)·2 = 160/3.\\n- Area of face ABC: with AB = (0, −2y, −2z), AC = (−2x, 0, −2z),\\n  area(ABC) = (1/2)|AB × AC| = 2√(x^2y^2 + x^2z^2 + y^2z^2) = 2√(100 + 64 + 25) = 6√21.\\n  All four faces are congruent, so total surface area S = 4·6√21 = 24√21.\\n- Inradius r satisfies V = (1/3)rS, so r = 3V/S = 160/(24√21) = 20/(3√21) = 20√21/63.\\n  Here m = 20, n = 21 (squarefree), p = 63 with gcd(m, p) = 1.\\n  Therefore m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Set up symmetric coordinates for a disphenoid so opposite edges are equal by construction.\\n2. Translate given edge lengths into equations for x^2, y^2, z^2 and solve.\\n3. Compute volume via determinant formula yielding V = (8/3)xyz.\\n4. Compute one face area using a cross product and multiply by 4 for total surface area.\\n5.

Such a tetrahedron admits a symmetric coordinate model using three mutually orthogonal vectors x, y, z, placing vertices at A = x + y + z, B = x − y − z, C = −x + y − z, D = −x − y + z. Opposite edge lengths then correspond to 2√(y^2+z^2), 2√(x^2+z^2), 2√(x^2+y^2). Solving for x^2, y^2, z^2 from the given edges yields explicit values, enabling computation of volume V and surface area S. The inradius r of a tangential tetrahedron satisfies r = 3V/S. The symmetry puts the incenter at the origin, simplifying area calculations via cross products of edge vectors.\\n\\n### Key Information Summary:\\n- Symmetric model: A = x + y + z, B = x − y − z, C = −x + y − z, D = −x − y + z with x ⟂ y ⟂ z.\\n- Edge relations:\\n  - 2√(y^2 + z^2) = √41 ⇒ y^2 + z^2 = 41/4\\n  - 2√(x^2 + z^2) = √80 ⇒ x^2 + z^2 = 20\\n  - 2√(x^2 + y^2) = √89 ⇒ x^2 + y^2 = 89/4\\n- Solving gives: x^2 = 16, y^2 = 25/4, z^2 = 4 ⇒ x=4, y=5/2, z=2.\\n- Volume: V = (8/3) x y z = (8/3)·4·(5/2)·2 = 160/3.\\n- Face area via cross product (e.g., for triangle ABC): |AB × AC| = 12√21 ⇒ area per face = 6√21 ⇒ total surface area S = 24√21.\\n- Inradius: r = 3V/S = 160/(24√21) = 20/(3√21) = 20√21/63.\\n- In m√n/p form: m=20, n=21 (squarefree), p=63, with gcd(m,p)=1.\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- Model the isosceles (disphenoid) tetrahedron with symmetric coordinates:\\n  A = (x, y, z), B = (x, −y, −z), C = (−x, y, −z), D = (−x, −y, z).\\n  Then opposite edges are equal in pairs with:\\n  AB^2 = 4(y^2 + z^2), AC^2 = 4(x^2 + z^2), BC^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2).\\n- From AB = √41, AC = √80, BC = √89:\\n  y^2 + z^2 = 41/4, x^2 + z^2 = 20, x^2 + y^2 = 89/4.\\n  Solving gives x^2 = 16, y^2 = 25/4, z^2 = 4, hence x = 4, y = 5/2, z = 2.\\n- Volume of this tetrahedron is V = (8/3)xyz = (8/3)·4·(5/2)·2 = 160/3.\\n- Area of face ABC: with AB = (0, −2y, −2z), AC = (−2x, 0, −2z),\\n  area(ABC) = (1/2)|AB × AC| = 2√(x^2y^2 + x^2z^2 + y^2z^2) = 2√(100 + 64 + 25) = 6√21.\\n  All four faces are congruent, so total surface area S = 4·6√21 = 24√21.\\n- Inradius r satisfies V = (1/3)rS, so r = 3V/S = 160/(24√21) = 20/(3√21) = 20√21/63.\\n  Here m = 20, n = 21 (squarefree), p = 63 with gcd(m, p) = 1.\\n  Therefore m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Set up symmetric coordinates for a disphenoid so opposite edges are equal by construction.\\n2. Translate given edge lengths into equations for x^2, y^2, z^2 and solve.\\n3. Compute volume via determinant formula yielding V = (8/3)xyz.\\n4. Compute one face area using a cross product and multiply by 4 for total surface area.\\n5.

Such a tetrahedron admits a symmetric coordinate model using three mutually orthogonal vectors x, y, z, placing vertices at A = x + y + z, B = x − y − z, C = −x + y − z, D = −x − y + z. Opposite edge lengths then correspond to 2√(y^2+z^2), 2√(x^2+z^2), 2√(x^2+y^2). Solving for x^2, y^2, z^2 from the given edges yields explicit values, enabling computation of volume V and surface area S. The inradius r of a tangential tetrahedron satisfies r = 3V/S. The symmetry puts the incenter at the origin, simplifying area calculations via cross products of edge vectors.\\n\\n### Key Information Summary:\\n- Symmetric model: A = x + y + z, B = x − y − z, C = −x + y − z, D = −x − y + z with x ⟂ y ⟂ z.\\n- Edge relations:\\n  - 2√(y^2 + z^2) = √41 ⇒ y^2 + z^2 = 41/4\\n  - 2√(x^2 + z^2) = √80 ⇒ x^2 + z^2 = 20\\n  - 2√(x^2 + y^2) = √89 ⇒ x^2 + y^2 = 89/4\\n- Solving gives: x^2 = 16, y^2 = 25/4, z^2 = 4 ⇒ x=4, y=5/2, z=2.\\n- Volume: V = (8/3) x y z = (8/3)·4·(5/2)·2 = 160/3.\\n- Face area via cross product (e.g., for triangle ABC): |AB × AC| = 12√21 ⇒ area per face = 6√21 ⇒ total surface area S = 24√21.\\n- Inradius: r = 3V/S = 160/(24√21) = 20/(3√21) = 20√21/63.\\n- In m√n/p form: m=20, n=21 (squarefree), p=63, with gcd(m,p)=1.\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- Model the isosceles (disphenoid) tetrahedron with symmetric coordinates:\\n  A = (x, y, z), B = (x, −y, −z), C = (−x, y, −z), D = (−x, −y, z).\\n  Then opposite edges are equal in pairs with:\\n  AB^2 = 4(y^2 + z^2), AC^2 = 4(x^2 + z^2), BC^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2).\\n- From AB = √41, AC = √80, BC = √89:\\n  y^2 + z^2 = 41/4, x^2 + z^2 = 20, x^2 + y^2 = 89/4.\\n  Solving gives x^2 = 16, y^2 = 25/4, z^2 = 4, hence x = 4, y = 5/2, z = 2.\\n- Volume of this tetrahedron is V = (8/3)xyz = (8/3)·4·(5/2)·2 = 160/3.\\n- Area of face ABC: with AB = (0, −2y, −2z), AC = (−2x, 0, −2z),\\n  area(ABC) = (1/2)|AB × AC| = 2√(x^2y^2 + x^2z^2 + y^2z^2) = 2√(100 + 64 + 25) = 6√21.\\n  All four faces are congruent, so total surface area S = 4·6√21 = 24√21.\\n- Inradius r satisfies V = (1/3)rS, so r = 3V/S = 160/(24√21) = 20/(3√21) = 20√21/63.\\n  Here m = 20, n = 21 (squarefree), p = 63 with gcd(m, p) = 1.\\n  Therefore m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1.

Such a tetrahedron admits an insphere; we must find its inradius r in the form m√n/p with n squarefree and gcd(m,p)=1, then output m+n+p as an integer. A symmetric coordinate model for disphenoids is A(x,y,z), B(x,-y,-z), C(-x,y,-z), D(-x,-y,z), giving opposite edge squares: AB^2=4(y^2+z^2), AC^2=4(x^2+z^2), AD^2=4(x^2+y^2). Solving yields x=4, y=5/2, z=2. The incenter is at the origin with inradius r = xyz / sqrt(x^2y^2 + x^2z^2 + y^2z^2) = 20/√189 = (20√21)/63, where gcd(20,63)=1 and 21 is squarefree.

The plane ABC has normal n=(5,8,-10), equation 5x+8y-10z=20.\\n- Inradius r is the distance from the origin to this plane: r=|−20|/||n||=20/√189=20√21/63.\\n- Here m=20, n=21, p=63, with gcd(20,63)=1 and 21 squarefree.\\n\\nTherefore, m+n+p=20+21+63=104.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Use standard symmetric coordinates for a disphenoid to relate edge lengths to x, y, z.\\n2. Solve the system for x, y, z from the given opposite edge lengths.\\n3. Determine the plane of a face (ABC), find its normal, and compute its equation.\\n4. Compute the inradius as the distance from the origin to that plane.\\n5.

Place vertices at A = x + y + z, B = x − y − z, C = −x + y − z, D = −x − y + z with x, y, z mutually orthogonal.\\n- Edge equations from AB = √41, AC = √80, BC = √89:\\n  - y^2 + z^2 = 41/4\\n  - x^2 + z^2 = 20\\n  - x^2 + y^2 = 89/4\\n  ⇒ x^2 = 16, y^2 = 25/4, z^2 = 4.\\n- Volume: V = (8/3)xyz = 160/3.\\n- Face area (all faces congruent): each = 6√21 ⇒ total surface area S = 24√21.\\n- Inradius: r = 3V/S = 20√21/63, so m = 20, n = 21 (squarefree), p = 63 (gcd(m, p) = 1).\\n- Sum: m + n + p = 104.\\nC0003 say to All: ### Context Analysis: \\nWe have a disphenoid (isosceles tetrahedron) with opposite edges equal: AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, BC=AD=√89. Such a tetrahedron admits an insphere; we must find its inradius r in the form m√n/p with n squarefree and gcd(m,p)=1, then output m+n+p as an integer. A symmetric coordinate model for disphenoids is A(x,y,z), B(x,-y,-z), C(-x,y,-z), D(-x,-y,z), giving opposite edge squares: AB^2=4(y^2+z^2), AC^2=4(x^2+z^2), AD^2=4(x^2+y^2). Solving yields x=4, y=5/2, z=2. The incenter is at the origin with inradius r = xyz / sqrt(x^2y^2 + x^2z^2 + y^2z^2) = 20/√189 = (20√21)/63, where gcd(20,63)=1 and 21 is squarefree. Hence m+n+p = 20+21+63 = 104.\\n\\n### Key Information Summary: \\n- Opposite edges: √41, √80, √89\\n- Symmetric model yields: x=4, y=5/2, z=2\\n- Inradius: r = 20/√189 = (20√21)/63\\n- m=20, n=21 (squarefree), p=63 (coprime with m)\\n- Final output: 104\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- A disphenoid (isosceles tetrahedron) with opposite equal edges can be modeled by vertices A=(x,y,z), B=(x,-y,-z), C=(-x,y,-z), D=(-x,-y,z).\\n- Given AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, AD=BC=√89, we have:\\n  - 2√(y^2+z^2)=√41 ⇒ y^2+z^2=41/4\\n  - 2√(x^2+z^2)=√80 ⇒ x^2+z^2=20\\n  - 2√(x^2+y^2)=√89 ⇒ x^2+y^2=89/4\\n- Solving yields z^2=4, y^2=25/4, x^2=16, so x=4, y=5/2, z=2.\\n- By symmetry, the incenter is at the origin. The plane ABC has normal n=(5,8,-10), equation 5x+8y-10z=20.\\n- Inradius r is the distance from the origin to this plane: r=|−20|/||n||=20/√189=20√21/63.\\n- Here m=20, n=21, p=63, with gcd(20,63)=1 and 21 squarefree.\\n\\nTherefore, m+n+p=20+21+63=104.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Use standard symmetric coordinates for a disphenoid to relate edge lengths to x, y, z.\\n2. Solve the system for x, y, z from the given opposite edge lengths.\\n3. Determine the plane of a face (ABC), find its normal, and compute its equation.\\n4. Compute the inradius as the distance from the origin to that plane.\\n5. Express r in the form m√n/p with n squarefree and gcd(m,p)=1.\\n6. Sum m+n+p to obtain 104.\\nC0004 say to All: ### Calculations: \\n- Model as a disphenoid with vertices (±x, ±y, ±z) in alternating signs so opposite edges are equal: \\n  2√(y^2+z^2)=√41, 2√(x^2+z^2)=√80, 2√(x^2+y^2)=√89.\\n- Solve:\\n  y^2+z^2=41/4, x^2+z^2=20, x^2+y^2=89/4 ⇒ z^2=4, x^2=16, y^2=25/4.\\n- One face plane (opposite (x,y,z)) has normal proportional to (5,8,10) and equation 5x+8y+10z = -20.\\n- Distance from origin to this plane (the inradius) r = |−20|/√(5^2+8^2+10^2) = 20/√189 = 20/(3√21) = 20√21/63.\\n- Thus r is in the form m√n/p with m=20, n=21 (squarefree), p=63, and gcd(20,63)=1.\\n- Therefore m+n+p = 20+21+63 = 104.\\n\\n### Numerical Results: 104\\nC0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: No inconsistencies found. Using the standard disphenoid coordinate model A=(x,y,z), B=(x,-y,-z), C=(-x,y,-z), D=(-x,-y,z), the given edge lengths yield x=4, y=5/2, z=2. The inradius is r = xyz / sqrt(x^2y^2 + x^2z^2 + y^2z^2) = 20/(3√21) = 20√21/63.

Such a tetrahedron admits an insphere; we must find its inradius r in the form m√n/p with n squarefree and gcd(m,p)=1, then output m+n+p as an integer. A symmetric coordinate model for disphenoids is A(x,y,z), B(x,-y,-z), C(-x,y,-z), D(-x,-y,z), giving opposite edge squares: AB^2=4(y^2+z^2), AC^2=4(x^2+z^2), AD^2=4(x^2+y^2). Solving yields x=4, y=5/2, z=2. The incenter is at the origin with inradius r = xyz / sqrt(x^2y^2 + x^2z^2 + y^2z^2) = 20/√189 = (20√21)/63, where gcd(20,63)=1 and 21 is squarefree. Hence m+n+p = 20+21+63 = 104.\\n\\n### Key Information Summary: \\n- Opposite edges: √41, √80, √89\\n- Symmetric model yields: x=4, y=5/2, z=2\\n- Inradius: r = 20/√189 = (20√21)/63\\n- m=20, n=21 (squarefree), p=63 (coprime with m)\\n- Final output: 104\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- A disphenoid (isosceles tetrahedron) with opposite equal edges can be modeled by vertices A=(x,y,z), B=(x,-y,-z), C=(-x,y,-z), D=(-x,-y,z).\\n- Given AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, AD=BC=√89, we have:\\n  - 2√(y^2+z^2)=√41 ⇒ y^2+z^2=41/4\\n  - 2√(x^2+z^2)=√80 ⇒ x^2+z^2=20\\n  - 2√(x^2+y^2)=√89 ⇒ x^2+y^2=89/4\\n- Solving yields z^2=4, y^2=25/4, x^2=16, so x=4, y=5/2, z=2.\\n- By symmetry, the incenter is at the origin. The plane ABC has normal n=(5,8,-10), equation 5x+8y-10z=20.\\n- Inradius r is the distance from the origin to this plane: r=|−20|/||n||=20/√189=20√21/63.\\n- Here m=20, n=21, p=63, with gcd(20,63)=1 and 21 squarefree.\\n\\nTherefore, m+n+p=20+21+63=104.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1.
