C0003 say to All: ### Context Analysis:
We are given a system of logarithmic equations involving positive real numbers x, y, z. The task is to convert these into linear equations by defining logarithmic variables in base 2 and identify the expression to compute. The ultimate goal is to find the value of |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| as a rational number m/n and then compute m+n, but the current subtask focuses on setting up the linear system.

### Key Information Summary:
- Define variables:
  - a = log2(x)
  - b = log2(y)
  - c = log2(z)
- Convert the system:
  - log2(x/(yz)) = 1/2 ⇒ a − b − c = 1/2
  - log2(y/(xz)) = 1/3 ⇒ b − a − c = 1/3
  - log2(z/(xy)) = 1/4 ⇒ c − a − b = 1/4
- Target expression to compute later:
  - L = log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4a + 3b + 2c

C0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:
- Introduce variables to linearize the logarithmic equations: let a = log2(x), b = log2(y), and c = log2(z).
- Use log properties: log2(x/(yz)) = log2(x) − log2(y) − log2(z) = a − b − c, and similarly for the other equations.

From the given system:
- log2(x/(yz)) = 1/2 ⇒ a − b − c = 1/2
- log2(y/(xz)) = 1/3 ⇒ b − a − c = 1/3
- log2(z/(xy)) = 1/4 ⇒ c − a − b = 1/4

The target becomes:
- L = log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4a + 3b + 2c.

### Proof Structure:
1. Define a = log2(x), b = log2(y), c = log2(z).
2. Translate each equation using log rules:
   - a − b − c = 1/2
   - b − a − c = 1/3
   - c − a − b = 1/4
3. Identify the target as a linear combination: L = 4a + 3b + 2c.

C0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:
Let a = log2(x), b = log2(y), c = log2(z). The given system becomes:
- a − b − c = 1/2
- b − a − c = 1/3
- c − a − b = 1/4

Adding the first two: −2c = 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6 ⇒ c = −5/12.
Adding the first and third: −2b = 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4 ⇒ b = −3/8.
Adding the second and third: −2a = 1/3 + 1/4 = 7/12 ⇒ a = −7/24.

We want L = log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4a + 3b + 2c.
Compute: 4a = −7/6, 3b = −9/8, 2c = −5/6.
Thus L = −7/6 − 9/8 − 5/6 = −2 − 9/8 = −25/8.
Therefore |L| = 25/8, so m/n = 25/8 and m + n = 33.

### Proof Structure:
- Substitute a = log2(x), b = log2(y), c = log2(z) to linearize the system.
- Solve pairwise sums to find c, b, a.
- Compute L = 4a + 3b + 2c.
- Take absolute value, reduce fraction, and sum numerator and denominator.
- Final answer: 33.

C0004 say to All: ### Calculations: Let a=log2(x), b=log2(y), c=log2(z). Then:
a−b−c=1/2, b−a−c=1/3, c−a−b=1/4.
Subtracting: a−b=1/12, a−c=1/8. Also, summing gives a+b+c=−13/12.
Solve: a=−7/24, b=−3/8, c=−5/12.
Compute L=log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)=4a+3b+2c=−25/8, so |L|=25/8. Thus m=25, n=8, m+n=33.

C0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: 
- Correctly set a = log2(x), b = log2(y), c = log2(z).
- Linear system derived:
  - a − b − c = 1/2
  - −a + b − c = 1/3
  - −a − b + c = 1/4
- Solving gives a = −7/24, b = −3/8, c = −5/12.
- Target L = 4a + 3b + 2c = −25/8, so |L| = 25/8.
- Fraction is in lowest terms; m = 25, n = 8, hence m + n = 33.
- No errors found.

### Corrections: 
None. Final answer: 33

C0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: Let a=log2 x, b=log2 y, c=log2 z. The system becomes:
a−b−c=1/2, −a+b−c=1/3, −a−b+c=1/4.
Solving gives a=−7/24, b=−3/8, c=−5/12. Then L=log2(x^4y^3z^2)=4a+3b+2c=−25/8, so |L|=25/8 with m=25, n=8, hence m+n=33.
All equations check when substituted back.

### Correctness Confirmation: Correct. Final answer: 33.
