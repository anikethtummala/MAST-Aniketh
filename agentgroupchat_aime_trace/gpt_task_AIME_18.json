Using Euler’s formula OI^2 = R(R − 2r), the perpendicularity implies AI^2 = OA^2 − OI^2 = R^2 − OI^2. This allows computing sin(A/2) = r/AI, then cos A and sin A, leading to side a = BC = 2R sin A. With tan(A/2) = r/(s − a), we find s and then use the area identity rs = abc/(4R) to get AB·AC = bc = (4Rrs)/a.\\n\\n### Key Information Summary:\\n- R = 13, r = 6, IA ⟂ OI\\n- OI^2 = R(R − 2r) = 13 → AI^2 = 169 − 13 = 156\\n- sin(A/2) = r/AI = 6/√156 = √(3/13) ⇒ cos A = 1 − 2 sin^2(A/2) = 7/13\\n- sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2√(3/13)·√(10/13) = 2√30/13\\n- a = BC = 2R sin A = 4√30\\n- tan(A/2) = r/(s − a) ⇒ s − a = r cot(A/2) = 2√30 ⇒ s = 6√30\\n- Using rs = abc/(4R): bc = AB·AC = (4R r s)/a = 468\\n- Target answer (integer): 468\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- Use Euler’s relation for incenter–circumcenter distance: OI^2 = R(R − 2r) = 13(13 − 12) = 13.\\n- Since IA ⟂ OI, triangle OIA is right at I, so AI^2 = OA^2 − OI^2 = R^2 − OI^2 = 169 − 13 = 156.\\n- Using sin(A/2) = r/AI gives sin^2(A/2) = 36/156 = 3/13, hence cos A = 1 − 2 sin^2(A/2) = 7/13 and sin A = √(1 − cos^2 A) = 2√30/13.\\n- Then a = BC = 2R sin A = 2·13·(2√30/13) = 4√30.\\n- Using tan(A/2) = r/(s − a) and tan^2(A/2) = (sin^2(A/2))/(cos^2(A/2)) = (3/13)/(10/13) = 3/10, we get s − a = r/ tan(A/2) = 6/√(3/10) = 2√30, hence s = 6√30.\\n- Area K = rs = 6·6√30 = 36√30, and also K = abc/(4R), so bc = (4RK)/a = (4·13·36√30)/(4√30) = 13·36 = 468.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1.

Using Euler’s formula OI^2 = R(R − 2r), the perpendicularity implies AI^2 = OA^2 − OI^2 = R^2 − OI^2. This allows computing sin(A/2) = r/AI, then cos A and sin A, leading to side a = BC = 2R sin A. With tan(A/2) = r/(s − a), we find s and then use the area identity rs = abc/(4R) to get AB·AC = bc = (4Rrs)/a.\\n\\n### Key Information Summary:\\n- R = 13, r = 6, IA ⟂ OI\\n- OI^2 = R(R − 2r) = 13 → AI^2 = 169 − 13 = 156\\n- sin(A/2) = r/AI = 6/√156 = √(3/13) ⇒ cos A = 1 − 2 sin^2(A/2) = 7/13\\n- sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2√(3/13)·√(10/13) = 2√30/13\\n- a = BC = 2R sin A = 4√30\\n- tan(A/2) = r/(s − a) ⇒ s − a = r cot(A/2) = 2√30 ⇒ s = 6√30\\n- Using rs = abc/(4R): bc = AB·AC = (4R r s)/a = 468\\n- Target answer (integer): 468\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- Use Euler’s relation for incenter–circumcenter distance: OI^2 = R(R − 2r) = 13(13 − 12) = 13.\\n- Since IA ⟂ OI, triangle OIA is right at I, so AI^2 = OA^2 − OI^2 = R^2 − OI^2 = 169 − 13 = 156.\\n- Using sin(A/2) = r/AI gives sin^2(A/2) = 36/156 = 3/13, hence cos A = 1 − 2 sin^2(A/2) = 7/13 and sin A = √(1 − cos^2 A) = 2√30/13.\\n- Then a = BC = 2R sin A = 2·13·(2√30/13) = 4√30.\\n- Using tan(A/2) = r/(s − a) and tan^2(A/2) = (sin^2(A/2))/(cos^2(A/2)) = (3/13)/(10/13) = 3/10, we get s − a = r/ tan(A/2) = 6/√(3/10) = 2√30, hence s = 6√30.\\n- Area K = rs = 6·6√30 = 36√30, and also K = abc/(4R), so bc = (4RK)/a = (4·13·36√30)/(4√30) = 13·36 = 468.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Apply Euler’s formula: OI^2 = R(R − 2r) to get OI^2 = 13.\\n2. From right triangle OIA, compute AI^2 = R^2 − OI^2 = 156.\\n3. Derive sin(A/2) = r/AI, leading to sin^2(A/2) = 3/13, hence cos A = 7/13 and sin A = 2√30/13.\\n4. Compute side a = BC = 2R sin A = 4√30.\\n5. Use tan(A/2) = r/(s − a) to find s = 6√30.\\n6.

Using Euler’s formula OI^2 = R(R − 2r), the perpendicularity implies AI^2 = OA^2 − OI^2 = R^2 − OI^2. This allows computing sin(A/2) = r/AI, then cos A and sin A, leading to side a = BC = 2R sin A. With tan(A/2) = r/(s − a), we find s and then use the area identity rs = abc/(4R) to get AB·AC = bc = (4Rrs)/a.\\n\\n### Key Information Summary:\\n- R = 13, r = 6, IA ⟂ OI\\n- OI^2 = R(R − 2r) = 13 → AI^2 = 169 − 13 = 156\\n- sin(A/2) = r/AI = 6/√156 = √(3/13) ⇒ cos A = 1 − 2 sin^2(A/2) = 7/13\\n- sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2√(3/13)·√(10/13) = 2√30/13\\n- a = BC = 2R sin A = 4√30\\n- tan(A/2) = r/(s − a) ⇒ s − a = r cot(A/2) = 2√30 ⇒ s = 6√30\\n- Using rs = abc/(4R): bc = AB·AC = (4R r s)/a = 468\\n- Target answer (integer): 468\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- Use Euler’s relation for incenter–circumcenter distance: OI^2 = R(R − 2r) = 13(13 − 12) = 13.\\n- Since IA ⟂ OI, triangle OIA is right at I, so AI^2 = OA^2 − OI^2 = R^2 − OI^2 = 169 − 13 = 156.\\n- Using sin(A/2) = r/AI gives sin^2(A/2) = 36/156 = 3/13, hence cos A = 1 − 2 sin^2(A/2) = 7/13 and sin A = √(1 − cos^2 A) = 2√30/13.\\n- Then a = BC = 2R sin A = 2·13·(2√30/13) = 4√30.\\n- Using tan(A/2) = r/(s − a) and tan^2(A/2) = (sin^2(A/2))/(cos^2(A/2)) = (3/13)/(10/13) = 3/10, we get s − a = r/ tan(A/2) = 6/√(3/10) = 2√30, hence s = 6√30.\\n- Area K = rs = 6·6√30 = 36√30, and also K = abc/(4R), so bc = (4RK)/a = (4·13·36√30)/(4√30) = 13·36 = 468.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1.

Common pitfalls for this problem include:\\n  - Misapplying the perpendicular condition IA ⟂ OI. The correct relation is OA^2 = OI^2 + AI^2 in triangle OIA.\\n  - Forgetting Euler’s formula OI^2 = R(R − 2r).\\n  - Using an incorrect value for AI; the correct formula is AI = r / sin(A/2).\\n  - Assuming IA ⟂ OI implies A = 60°, which is false.\\n  - Errors when expressing bc via a, b + c, and cos A using the Law of Cosines.\\n\\nAll computations checked:\\n- OI^2 = R(R − 2r) = 13(13 − 12) = 13.\\n- From OA^2 = OI^2 + AI^2 with OA = R, AI = r csc(A/2): sin^2(A/2) = r/(2R) = 3/13.\\n- Then sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2√(3/13)√(10/13) = 2√30/13, so a = 2R sin A = 4√30.\\n- Using s − a = r cot(A/2) with cot(A/2) = √(10/3), we get s − a = 2√30, hence b + c = 2s − a = 8√30.\\n- From Law of Cosines: a^2 = (b + c)^2 − 2bc(1 + cos A) giving bc = [(b + c)^2 − a^2]/[2(1 + cos A)].\\n- cos A = 1 − 2 sin^2(A/2) = 7/13, so 2(1 + cos A) = 40/13.\\n- Therefore bc = (1920 − 480)/(40/13) = 1440 × 13/40 = 468.\\n\\nNo inconsistencies found.\\n\\n### Corrections: \\n- Final answer (AB·AC): 468\\nC0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: \\n- Given R = 13, r = 6, and IA ⟂ OI.\\n- Euler’s formula: OI^2 = R(R − 2r) = 13(13 − 12) = 13.\\n- Right triangle AIO (right at I): AO = R ⇒ AI^2 = R^2 − OI^2 = 169 − 13 = 156.\\n- Using AI = r / sin(A/2): sin(A/2) = r/AI = 6/√156 = √(3/13).\\n- Then sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2√(3/13)√(10/13) = 2√30/13.\\n- a = BC = 2R sin A = 2·13·(2√30/13) = 4√30.\\n- tan(A/2) = r/(s − a) = √(3/10) ⇒ s − a = r/√(3/10) = 2√30 ⇒ s = 6√30.\\n- Area K = rs = 6·6√30 = 36√30.\\n- Using K = abc/(4R): bc = (4R·K)/a = (4·13·36√30)/(4√30) = 468.\\n- Therefore AB·AC = bc = 468.\\n\\n### Correctness Confirmation: \\nAll geometric relations and computations are standard and consistent.

Using Euler’s formula OI^2 = R(R − 2r), the perpendicularity implies AI^2 = OA^2 − OI^2 = R^2 − OI^2. This allows computing sin(A/2) = r/AI, then cos A and sin A, leading to side a = BC = 2R sin A. With tan(A/2) = r/(s − a), we find s and then use the area identity rs = abc/(4R) to get AB·AC = bc = (4Rrs)/a.\\n\\n### Key Information Summary:\\n- R = 13, r = 6, IA ⟂ OI\\n- OI^2 = R(R − 2r) = 13 → AI^2 = 169 − 13 = 156\\n- sin(A/2) = r/AI = 6/√156 = √(3/13) ⇒ cos A = 1 − 2 sin^2(A/2) = 7/13\\n- sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2√(3/13)·√(10/13) = 2√30/13\\n- a = BC = 2R sin A = 4√30\\n- tan(A/2) = r/(s − a) ⇒ s − a = r cot(A/2) = 2√30 ⇒ s = 6√30\\n- Using rs = abc/(4R): bc = AB·AC = (4R r s)/a = 468\\n- Target answer (integer): 468\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- Use Euler’s relation for incenter–circumcenter distance: OI^2 = R(R − 2r) = 13(13 − 12) = 13.\\n- Since IA ⟂ OI, triangle OIA is right at I, so AI^2 = OA^2 − OI^2 = R^2 − OI^2 = 169 − 13 = 156.\\n- Using sin(A/2) = r/AI gives sin^2(A/2) = 36/156 = 3/13, hence cos A = 1 − 2 sin^2(A/2) = 7/13 and sin A = √(1 − cos^2 A) = 2√30/13.\\n- Then a = BC = 2R sin A = 2·13·(2√30/13) = 4√30.\\n- Using tan(A/2) = r/(s − a) and tan^2(A/2) = (sin^2(A/2))/(cos^2(A/2)) = (3/13)/(10/13) = 3/10, we get s − a = r/ tan(A/2) = 6/√(3/10) = 2√30, hence s = 6√30.\\n- Area K = rs = 6·6√30 = 36√30, and also K = abc/(4R), so bc = (4RK)/a = (4·13·36√30)/(4√30) = 13·36 = 468.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Apply Euler’s formula: OI^2 = R(R − 2r) to get OI^2 = 13.\\n2. From right triangle OIA, compute AI^2 = R^2 − OI^2 = 156.\\n3. Derive sin(A/2) = r/AI, leading to sin^2(A/2) = 3/13, hence cos A = 7/13 and sin A = 2√30/13.\\n4. Compute side a = BC = 2R sin A = 4√30.\\n5. Use tan(A/2) = r/(s − a) to find s = 6√30.\\n6. Equate areas K = rs = abc/(4R) to solve for bc = AB·AC = 468.\\nC0004 say to All: ### Calculations: \\n- OI^2 = R(R − 2r) = 13(13 − 12) = 13\\n- IA ⟂ OI ⇒ OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2 ⇒ 169 = 13 + IA^2 ⇒ IA^2 = 156\\n- AI = r / sin(A/2) ⇒ sin^2(A/2) = r^2 / AI^2 = 36/156 = 3/13\\n- sin(A/2) = √(3/13), cos(A/2) = √(10/13) ⇒ sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2√30/13\\n- a = BC = 2R sin A = 2·13·(2√30/13) = 4√30\\n- tan(A/2) = √(3/10) ⇒ cot(A/2) = √(10/3)\\n- s − a = r cot(A/2) = 6·√(10/3) = 2√30 ⇒ s = a + 2√30 = 6√30\\n- Area K = r s = 6·6√30 = 36√30\\n- bc = (4 R K)/a = (4·13·36√30)/(4√30) = 13·36 = 468\\n\\n### Numerical Results: 468\\nC0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: \\n- No prior solution steps were provided to review. Common pitfalls for this problem include:\\n  - Misapplying the perpendicular condition IA ⟂ OI. The correct relation is OA^2 = OI^2 + AI^2 in triangle OIA.\\n  - Forgetting Euler’s formula OI^2 = R(R − 2r).\\n  - Using an incorrect value for AI; the correct formula is AI = r / sin(A/2).\\n  - Assuming IA ⟂ OI implies A = 60°, which is false.\\n  - Errors when expressing bc via a, b + c, and cos A using the Law of Cosines.\\n\\nAll computations checked:\\n- OI^2 = R(R − 2r) = 13(13 − 12) = 13.\\n- From OA^2 = OI^2 + AI^2 with OA = R, AI = r csc(A/2): sin^2(A/2) = r/(2R) = 3/13.\\n- Then sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2√(3/13)√(10/13) = 2√30/13, so a = 2R sin A = 4√30.\\n- Using s − a = r cot(A/2) with cot(A/2) = √(10/3), we get s − a = 2√30, hence b + c = 2s − a = 8√30.\\n- From Law of Cosines: a^2 = (b + c)^2 − 2bc(1 + cos A) giving bc = [(b + c)^2 − a^2]/[2(1 + cos A)].\\n- cos A = 1 − 2 sin^2(A/2) = 7/13, so 2(1 + cos A) = 40/13.\\n- Therefore bc = (1920 − 480)/(40/13) = 1440 × 13/40 = 468.\\n\\nNo inconsistencies found.\\n\\n### Corrections: \\n- Final answer (AB·AC): 468\\nC0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: \\n- Given R = 13, r = 6, and IA ⟂ OI.\\n- Euler’s formula: OI^2 = R(R − 2r) = 13(13 − 12) = 13.\\n- Right triangle AIO (right at I): AO = R ⇒ AI^2 = R^2 − OI^2 = 169 − 13 = 156.\\n- Using AI = r / sin(A/2): sin(A/2) = r/AI = 6/√156 = √(3/13).\\n- Then sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2√(3/13)√(10/13) = 2√30/13.\\n- a = BC = 2R sin A = 2·13·(2√30/13) = 4√30.\\n- tan(A/2) = r/(s − a) = √(3/10) ⇒ s − a = r/√(3/10) = 2√30 ⇒ s = 6√30.\\n- Area K = rs = 6·6√30 = 36√30.\\n- Using K = abc/(4R): bc = (4R·K)/a = (4·13·36√30)/(4√30) = 468.\\n- Therefore AB·AC = bc = 468.\\n\\n### Correctness Confirmation: \\nAll geometric relations and computations are standard and consistent. The perpendicularity condition IA ⟂ OI correctly yields AI via the right triangle with AO = R; formulas for OI^2, AI, and trigonometric half-angle relations are applied correctly. The final product AB·AC = 468 is validated and is an integer as required.\\n\\nPlease summarize the key content from the group chat messages:\", \"model_response\": {\"message\": \"- Used Euler’s formula: OI^2 = R(R − 2r) = 13.\\n- From IA ⟂ OI and AO = R: AI^2 = R^2 − OI^2 = 156.\\n- sin(A/2) = r/AI = √(3/13) ⇒ cos A = 7/13, sin A = 2√30/13.\\n- a = BC = 2R sin A = 4√30.\\n- Using tan(A/2) = r/(s − a): s − a = 2√30 ⇒ s = 6√30.\\n- Area K = rs = 36√30; also K = abc/(4R) ⇒ bc = (4R K)/a = 468.\\n- Conclusion: AB·AC = 468.\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 504, \"prompt_tokens\": 2326, \"total_tokens\": 2830, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 320, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}, \"metadata\": {\"engine\": \"gpt-5\", \"provider\": \"external_api\"}}, \"output\": \"- Used Euler’s formula: OI^2 = R(R − 2r) = 13.\\n- From IA ⟂ OI and AO = R: AI^2 = R^2 − OI^2 = 156.\\n- sin(A/2) = r/AI = √(3/13) ⇒ cos A = 7/13, sin A = 2√30/13.\\n- a = BC = 2R sin A = 4√30.\\n- Using tan(A/2) = r/(s − a): s − a = 2√30 ⇒ s = 6√30.\\n- Area K = rs = 36√30; also K = abc/(4R) ⇒ bc = (4R K)/a = 468.\\n- Conclusion: AB·AC = 468.\", \"func_name\": \"run_summarize_group_message\"}"}
