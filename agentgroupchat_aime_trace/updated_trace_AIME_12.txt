C0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:
- Let s be Aya’s walking speed (km/h) and t be minutes spent at the coffee shop.
- Total time equations: 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4.
- Subtract to eliminate t and solve for s, then find t.
- For speed s + 1/2, compute walking time 9/(s+1/2) and add t minutes; convert to minutes.

### Proof Structure:
1. From the two scenarios:
   - 9/s + t/60 = 4
   - 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4
2. Subtract:
   9/s − 9/(s+2) = 1.6
   ⇒ 9[(s+2 − s)/(s(s+2))] = 1.6
   ⇒ 18/[s(s+2)] = 1.6
   ⇒ s(s+2) = 18/1.6 = 11.25
   ⇒ s^2 + 2s − 11.25 = 0
   ⇒ s = (−2 + √49)/2 = 2.5 (positive root).
3. Find t:
   9/s = 9/2.5 = 3.6 hours ⇒ t/60 = 4 − 3.6 = 0.4 ⇒ t = 24 minutes.
4. At speed s + 1/2 = 3 km/h:
   Walking time = 9/3 = 3 hours = 180 minutes.
   Total time = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.

- Let s be walking speed (km/h) and t be coffee time (minutes).
- Total time equations (hours):
  1) 9/s + t/60 = 4
  2) 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4
- Subtract: 9/s − 9/(s+2) = 4 − 2.4 = 1.6
  => 9[(s+2 − s)/(s(s+2))] = 1.6
  => 18/[s(s+2)] = 1.6 = 8/5
  => 18*5 = 8(s^2 + 2s)
  => 90 = 8s^2 + 16s
  => 4s^2 + 8s − 45 = 0
  => s = [−8 + sqrt(64 + 720)]/8 = (−8 + 28)/8 = 2.5 km/h
- Find t: 9/2.5 = 3.6 h, so t/60 = 4 − 3.6 = 0.4 ⇒ t = 24 minutes
- At speed s + 1/2 = 3 km/h: walking time = 9/3 = 3 h = 180 minutes
- Total time including coffee = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes

### Numerical Results: 
- s = 2.5 km/h
- t = 24 minutes
- Total time at s + 1/2: 204 minutes
- Final answer: 204

C0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: The setup is correct: 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. Subtracting gives 18/[s(s+2)] = 1.6, leading to s = 2.5 km/h. Then t = 24 minutes. For speed s + 1/2 = 3 km/h, walking time is 180 minutes; including coffee yields 204 minutes. No logical or computational errors found.
### Corrections: None. Final answer: 204

C0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: Set up equations for total time in hours: 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4 (since 2 h 24 min = 2.4 h). Subtract to get 18/[s(s+2)] = 1.6 = 8/5, so s(s+2) = 45/4, yielding s = 2.5 km/h (positive root). Then 9/2.5 = 3.6 h, so t = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4 h = 24 min. At speed s + 1/2 = 3 km/h, walk time is 9/3 = 3 h = 180 min; including coffee gives 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.
### Correctness Confirmation: All computations are consistent and units correct. Final answer: 204

Set up equations with t in hours:
- 9/s + t/60 = 4
- 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

Subtract to eliminate t:
9/s − 9/(s+2) = 1.6 ⇒ 18/[s(s+2)] = 1.6 = 8/5 ⇒ s(s+2) = 45/4 ⇒ s^2 + 2s − 45/4 = 0 ⇒ s = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h.

Find t:
9/2.5 = 3.6 hours, so t/60 = 4 − 3.6 = 0.4 ⇒ t = 24 minutes.

At speed s + 1/2 = 3 km/h:
Walk time = 9/3 = 3 hours; total including coffee = 3 hours 24 minutes = 204 minutes.

### Correctness Confirmation: 
Both given conditions are satisfied by s = 2.5 km/h and t = 24 minutes, and the computed total time at 3 km/h is correctly 204 minutes. The final integer answer is 204.

C0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:
Let s be Aya’s walking speed (km/h) and t the coffee time (minutes). The total times are:
- 9/s + t/60 = 4
- 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

Subtracting gives:
9/s − 9/(s+2) = 1.6 = 8/5
=> 18/[s(s+2)] = 8/5
=> 8s^2 + 16s − 90 = 0
=> 4s^2 + 8s − 45 = 0
=> s = 2.5 (discard negative root)

Then 9/s = 9/2.5 = 3.6 hours, so t/60 = 4 − 3.6 = 0.4 ⇒ t = 24 minutes.

At speed s + 1/2 = 3 km/h, walking time = 9/3 = 3 hours; including coffee: 3 hours 24 minutes = 204 minutes.

### Proof Structure:
- Set up total time equations including coffee time.
- Subtract to eliminate t and solve quadratic for s.
- Compute t from one equation.
- Evaluate total time at s + 1/2 and convert to minutes.
- Final answer: 204

C0003 say to All: ### Context Analysis:
Aya walks a fixed 9 km each morning and includes a fixed coffee stop of t minutes in her total time. Two scenarios are given:
- At speed s km/h, total time is 4 hours: walking time 9/s hours plus coffee t/60 hours.
- At speed s+2 km/h, total time is 2 hours 24 minutes (2.4 hours): walking time 9/(s+2) hours plus coffee t/60 hours.
We must find the total time in minutes when she walks at speed s + 1/2 km/h, still including the same coffee time t.

### Key Information Summary:
- Equations: 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4
- Solving gives s = 2.5 km/h and t = 24 minutes.
- At s + 1/2 = 3 km/h, walking time = 9/3 = 3 hours = 180 minutes.
- Total time including coffee = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes (integer output required).
