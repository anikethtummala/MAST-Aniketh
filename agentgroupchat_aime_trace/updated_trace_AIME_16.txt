C0003 say to All: ### Context Analysis:
We consider rectangular boxes with side lengths a, b, c > 0. The surface area constraint is 2(ab + bc + ca) = 54, so ab + bc + ca = 27. The volume constraint is abc = 23. The smallest sphere that contains a given box has radius equal to half the space diagonal, i.e., r_box = (1/2)√(a^2 + b^2 + c^2). We need the radius r that works for all such boxes, so r is half the maximum possible space diagonal over all feasible (a, b, c).

### Key Information Summary:
- Variables: a, b, c > 0.
- Constraints: 
  - ab + bc + ca = 27
  - abc = 23
- Objective: maximize a^2 + b^2 + c^2 to maximize the space diagonal.
- Reformulation:
  - Let s1 = a + b + c, s2 = ab + bc + ca = 27, s3 = abc = 23.
  - a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = s1^2 − 2s2 = s1^2 − 54.
  - Therefore r^2 = (1/4)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = (1/4)(s1^2 − 54).
- Task reduces to maximizing s1 = a + b + c subject to s2 = 27 and s3 = 23 (likely attained at a = b by symmetry).

C0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:
- Let the rectangular box have side lengths a, b, c > 0.
- The constraints are:
  - Surface area: 2(ab + bc + ca) = 54 ⇒ ab + bc + ca = 27.
  - Volume: abc = 23.
- For a given box, the smallest enclosing sphere has radius r_box = (1/2)√(a^2 + b^2 + c^2). To contain every such box, we need r = (1/2)√(max(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)).
- Note that a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 − 2(ab + bc + ca) = s1^2 − 54, where s1 = a + b + c.
- Therefore, maximizing a^2 + b^2 + c^2 under the constraints is equivalent to maximizing s1 = a + b + c.
- The feasible set { (a,b,c) > 0 : ab + bc + ca = 27, abc = 23 } is compact in the positive octant (variables are bounded away from 0 and ∞ by the constraints), so a maximum exists.
- Use Lagrange multipliers to maximize s1 subject to the two symmetric constraints. Setting ∇(a + b + c) = λ∇(ab + bc + ca) + μ∇(abc) yields for each variable:
  - 1 = λ(b + c) + μ bc,
  - 1 = λ(c + a) + μ ca,
  - 1 = λ(a + b) + μ ab.
  Subtracting any two equations shows that either all three variables are equal or at least two are equal at a stationary point. The all-equal case gives a = b = c = 3, which violates abc = 23, hence at the maximizer two sides are equal.

### Proof Structure:
1. Variables and constraints:
   - a, b, c > 0,
   - ab + bc + ca = 27,
   - abc = 23.
2. Objective reformulation:
   - Maximize a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 − 54 ⇒ maximize s1 = a + b + c.
   - Then r^2 = (1/4)(s1^2 − 54).
3. Symmetry and structure of maximizer:
   - By Lagrange multipliers on symmetric constraints, any interior maximizer has at least two equal sides.
   - The all-equal case is infeasible; thus assume a = b.
4. Reduced two-variable system:
   - Let a = b = x, c = y with
     - x^2 + 2xy = 27,
     - x^2 y = 23.
   - Then s1 = 2x + y and r^2 = (1/4)[(2x + y)^2 − 54].
5. Conclusion for optimization modeling:
   - The problem reduces to solving the two-variable system with a = b to maximize 2x + y, yielding r^2 as above; hence r is half the maximal space diagonal among boxes satisfying the given surface area and volume.

C0004 say to All: ### Calculations: 
- Let box side lengths be a, b, c > 0 with ab + bc + ca = 27 and abc = 23 (from surface area 54 and volume 23).
- The smallest enclosing sphere has radius r = (1/2)·sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2). To maximize r, maximize d^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 under the constraints.
- By symmetry at extremum, set a = b = x, c = y. Then:
  - x^2 + 2xy = 27
  - x^2 y = 23 ⇒ y = 23/x^2
  - Substitute into first: x^2 + 46/x = 27 ⇒ x^3 − 27x + 46 = 0
  - Roots: x = 2, x = −1 + 2√6 (> 0)
- Compute S = a + b + c = 2x + y = 2x + 23/x^2 at the roots:
  - For x = 2: y = 23/4, S = 4 + 23/4 = 39/4
  - For x = −1 + 2√6 ≈ 3.899: y ≈ 1.513, S ≈ 9.311 < 39/4
  ⇒ Maximum at x = 2, y = 23/4.
- Then d^2 = (a + b + c)^2 − 2(ab + bc + ca) = (39/4)^2 − 54 = 1521/16 − 864/16 = 657/16.
- Hence r^2 = d^2/4 = 657/64. So p = 657, q = 64, and p + q = 721.

C0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: 
- The modeling of the constraints is correct: for side lengths a, b, c > 0, surface area 54 implies ab + bc + ca = 27, and volume 23 implies abc = 23.
- The radius of the smallest enclosing sphere for a given box is correctly identified as half the space diagonal: r_box = (1/2)√(a^2 + b^2 + c^2). Therefore r = (1/2)√(max(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)) over all feasible boxes.
- The relation a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 − 2(ab + bc + ca) is correctly specialized to a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 − 54.
- The step “By symmetry/Lagrange multipliers, at the maximizer two sides are equal” is plausible but was asserted without justification. This needs a brief justification (e.g., via Lagrange multipliers or the double-root condition from the cubic with Vieta’s formulas).

### Corrections: 
- Formalize the optimization target:
  - Let s = a + b + c. Since ab + bc + ca is fixed at 27, maximizing a^2 + b^2 + c^2 is equivalent to maximizing s, because a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = s^2 − 54.
  - Hence r^2 = (1/4) max(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = (1/4)(max s^2 − 54).
- Justify symmetry at the optimizer:
  - By Lagrange multipliers on maximizing s subject to ab + bc + ca = 27 and abc = 23 (both symmetric constraints), an extremum occurs when at least two variables are equal; alternatively, viewing a, b, c as roots of t^3 − s t^2 + 27 t − 23 = 0, extremal s arises when the polynomial has a double root, implying two equal sides.
- Reduce to two variables:
  - Set a = b = x, c = y with x, y > 0. Then the constraints become:
    - x^2 + 2xy = 27
    - x^2 y = 23
  - The objective becomes:
    - s = 2x + y, hence r^2 = (1/4)[(2x + y)^2 − 54].
- This completes the precise modeling needed for the subsequent optimization and computation.

C0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: 
- Let a, b, c > 0 be the side lengths of a rectangular box. The given surface area 54 implies 2(ab + bc + ca) = 54, hence ab + bc + ca = 27. The given volume 23 implies abc = 23. These constraints are correctly extracted.
- For a given box, the smallest enclosing sphere has radius r_box = (1/2)√(a^2 + b^2 + c^2), since the space diagonal is the maximum distance between two points in the box. A sphere centered at the box’s center with this radius contains the entire box, and no smaller sphere can contain both opposite vertices. This is correct.
- To contain every box satisfying the constraints, the sphere must accommodate the worst case (largest space diagonal). Thus r = (1/2) max √(a^2 + b^2 + c^2), and r^2 = (1/4) max(a^2 + b^2 + c^2).
- Using the identity a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 − 2(ab + bc + ca) = (a + b + c)^2 − 54, maximizing a^2 + b^2 + c^2 is equivalent to maximizing s = a + b + c under ab + bc + ca = 27 and abc = 23.
- By symmetry and standard Lagrange multipliers/KKT reasoning for symmetric constraints, an extremum occurs with at least two equal sides (e.g., a = b), justifying reduction to a two-variable optimization.

### Correctness Confirmation: 
The parsing and modeling are correct and complete. The objective and constraints are properly formalized, and the reduction to maximizing the sum of side lengths is valid. Proceed to optimization and computation.

C0003 say to All: ### Context Analysis:
We are considering rectangular boxes with side lengths a, b, c > 0 such that their surface area is 54 and volume is 23. This gives constraints:
- ab + bc + ca = 27 (since surface area = 2(ab + bc + ca))
- abc = 23

The radius r of the smallest sphere containing such a box equals half the space diagonal, so r = (1/2)√(a^2 + b^2 + c^2). To ensure the sphere contains every such box, we must maximize a^2 + b^2 + c^2 over all boxes satisfying the constraints. Note that a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 − 2(ab + bc + ca) = s^2 − 54, so maximizing this is equivalent to maximizing s = a + b + c.

By symmetry, at the extremum we can assume a = b = x and c = y. The constraints become:
- x^2 + 2xy = 27
- x^2 y = 23 ⇒ y = 23/x^2

Substitute into the first: x^2 + 46/x = 27 ⇒ x^3 − 27x + 46 = 0. The real positive roots are x = 2 and x = −1 + 2√6. For each, compute y = 23/x^2 and s = 2x + y, then choose the larger s to maximize a^2 + b^2 + c^2, hence r^2 = (s^2 − 54)/4. Finally express r^2 = p/q in lowest terms and output p + q.

### Key Information Summary:

- Constraints: ab + bc + ca = 27; abc = 23
- Objective: maximize a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = s^2 − 54, where s = a + b + c
- Sphere radius: r = (1/2)√(a^2 + b^2 + c^2), so r^2 = (s^2 − 54)/4 at the maximizing box
- Symmetry reduction: set a = b = x, c = y
- Equations: x^2 + 2xy = 27; y = 23/x^2 ⇒ cubic x^3 − 27x + 46 = 0
- Positive roots: x = 2 and x = −1 + 2√6; evaluate s = 2x + 23/x^2 for each, pick maximum

C0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:
- Let box side lengths be a, b, c > 0. Given surface area 2(ab+bc+ca) = 54 ⇒ ab+bc+ca = 27, and volume abc = 23.
- The smallest sphere containing the box must have radius r = (1/2)√(a^2 + b^2 + c^2). Thus we need to maximize a^2 + b^2 + c^2 over all boxes satisfying the constraints.
- Since a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 − 2(ab + bc + ca) = s^2 − 54, maximizing a^2 + b^2 + c^2 is equivalent to maximizing s = a + b + c.
- By symmetry and Lagrange multipliers, at the extremum with fixed ab+bc+ca and abc, either a = b = c or two variables are equal. The equal case a = b = c gives abc = 27, not 23, so not feasible. Hence at the extremum we may set a = b = x, c = y.
- Constraints become: x^2 + 2xy = 27 and x^2 y = 23 ⇒ y = 23/x^2. Substituting yields x^2 + 46/x = 27 ⇒ x^3 − 27x + 46 = 0.
- Solve: x = 2 is a root; factoring gives (x − 2)(x^2 + 2x − 23) = 0, with positive roots x = 2 and x = −1 + 2√6.
- For each x, s = 2x + 23/x^2. Evaluate:
  - x = 2 ⇒ y = 23/4, s = 4 + 23/4 = 39/4.
  - x = −1 + 2√6 ≈ 3.899 ⇒ y ≈ 1.514 ⇒ s ≈ 9.312 < 39/4 = 9.75.
  Thus the maximum s is 39/4 at (a, b, c) = (2, 2, 23/4) up to permutation.
- Therefore, max(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = s^2 − 54 = (39/4)^2 − 54 = 1521/16 − 54 = 657/16. Hence r^2 = (1/4)·(657/16) = 657/64, so p + q = 657 + 64 = 721.

### Proof Structure:
1. Set up constraints: ab + bc + ca = 27, abc = 23; objective: maximize a^2 + b^2 + c^2.
2. Note a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = s^2 − 54; hence maximize s = a + b + c.
3. Use Lagrange multipliers to argue an extremum occurs with two equal sides; equal-all case infeasible.
4. Let a = b = x, c = y; reduce constraints to x^3 − 27x + 46 = 0 via y = 23/x^2 and x^2 + 2xy = 27.
5. Solve cubic: x ∈ {2, −1 + 2√6} (positive roots).
6. Compare s = 2x + 23/x^2; maximum at x = 2 gives s = 39/4.
7. Compute r^2 = (s^2 − 54)/4 = 657/64; hence p + q = 721.

- Let the box have sides a, b, c > 0. Constraints: ab + bc + ca = 27 and abc = 23.
- The sphere must contain the space diagonal d = sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2). We need to maximize d, hence maximize a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = s1^2 − 2(ab + bc + ca) = s1^2 − 54, so maximize s1 = a + b + c.
- By symmetry, at extremum set b = c = x, a = y. Then:
  - abc = y x^2 = 23 ⇒ y = 23/x^2
  - ab + bc + ca = x^2 + 2xy = 27 ⇒ x^2 + 46/x = 27 ⇒ x^3 − 27x + 46 = 0
- Solve cubic: (x − 2)(x^2 + 2x − 23) = 0 ⇒ positive roots: x = 2 or x = −1 + 2√6 ≈ 3.899
- Compute s1 = y + 2x with y = 23/x^2:
  - For x = 2: y = 23/4, s1 = 23/4 + 4 = 39/4 = 9.75
  - For x ≈ 3.899: y ≈ 1.514, s1 ≈ 9.312
  ⇒ Maximum s1 occurs at x = 2, y = 23/4.
- Then a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (39/4)^2 − 54 = 1521/16 − 864/16 = 657/16.
- Space diagonal squared d^2 = 657/16 ⇒ r^2 = d^2/4 = 657/64.

C0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: 
Let a, b, c > 0 be the side lengths of a rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23. Then:
- ab + bc + ca = 27
- abc = 23

The smallest enclosing sphere for a box has radius r = (1/2)√(a^2 + b^2 + c^2). Hence, to find the smallest r that works for all such boxes, we maximize a^2 + b^2 + c^2 under the constraints. Since a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca), this is equivalent to maximizing s = a + b + c.

Using Lagrange multipliers (or symmetry), the extremum occurs when two variables are equal: let a = c = x, b = y. Then:
- 2xy + x^2 = 27
- x^2 y = 23 ⇒ y = 23/x^2

Substitute into the first: x^2 + 46/x = 27 ⇒ x^3 - 27x + 46 = 0 ⇒ (x - 2)(x^2 + 2x - 23) = 0, giving x = 2 or x = -1 + 2√6. Compute s = 2x + y = 2x + 23/x^2:
- For x = 2: y = 23/4, s = 4 + 23/4 = 39/4 = 9.75
- For x = -1 + 2√6 ≈ 3.899: s ≈ 9.311

Thus the maximum s is at x = 2, y = 23/4. Then:
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = s^2 - 2·27 = (39/4)^2 - 54 = 1521/16 - 864/16 = 657/16

So the maximum squared space diagonal is 657/16, hence r^2 = (1/4)(657/16) = 657/64. Therefore p/q = 657/64, and p + q = 657 + 64 = 721.

### Correctness Confirmation: 
The optimization is correctly reduced to maximizing the sum s under fixed symmetric sums, with the extremum attained when two sides are equal. The cubic solution and selection of the maximizing critical point are correct. The computation of r^2 and p + q is accurate. Final answer: 721.
