C0003 say to All: ### Context Analysis:
We consider the family F of unit-length segments with endpoints on the coordinate axes in the first quadrant. Any such segment can be represented by intercepts P=(x,0) and Q=(0,y) with x>0, y>0, and x^2 + y^2 = 1. The line of the segment is X/x + Y/y = 1. The segment AB from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, √3/2) is itself in F since its length is 1 and its intercepts are x=1/2, y=√3/2.

A point (u,v) lies on some segment in F if and only if there exist x,y>0 satisfying:
- x^2 + y^2 = 1
- u/x + v/y = 1

We seek a unique point C on AB (distinct from A and B) that lies on no other segment from F besides AB. This means, for that (u,v)=C, the above system has exactly one solution (x,y), namely (1/2, √3/2). Geometrically in (x,y)-space, the curve u/x + v/y = 1 must be tangent to the unit circle x^2 + y^2 = 1 at (x,y)=(1/2, √3/2).

### Key Information Summary:
- Family F: segments with P=(x,0), Q=(0,y), x,y>0, x^2 + y^2 = 1; line equation: X/x + Y/y = 1.
- Point (u,v) lies on some F-segment iff ∃ x,y>0 with:
  - x^2 + y^2 = 1
  - u/x + v/y = 1
- AB is in F with (x,y)=(1/2, √3/2).
- C lies on AB: u/(1/2) + v/(√3/2) = 1, with u,v>0 and C ≠ A,B.
- Uniqueness (no other F-segment through C) ⇔ tangency condition at (x,y)=(1/2, √3/2):
  - Gradients proportional: (-u/x^2, -v/y^2) ∥ (2x, 2y) ⇒ u/x^3 = v/y^3
- System to determine C:
  - u/(1/2) + v/(√3/2) = 1
  - u/(1/2)^3 = v/(√3/2)^3
- Once C is found, compute OC^2 = u^2 + v^2 = p/q and report p+q.

C0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:
- Any segment in the family F has endpoints P=(a,0) on the x-axis and Q=(0,b) on the y-axis with a>0, b>0, and length 1, hence a^2 + b^2 = 1. The line through this segment is x/a + y/b = 1, and every point on the segment satisfies this.
- A point (x,y) in the first quadrant lies on some segment of F if and only if there exist a,b>0 with a^2 + b^2 = 1 such that x/a + y/b = 1.
- The segment AB corresponds to (a,b) = (1/2, √3/2). Points on AB satisfy 2x + (2/√3) y = 1.
- The unique point C on AB that lies on no other segment corresponds to the condition that among all (a,b) on the unit circle, the level set x/a + y/b = 1 touches the circle only at (1/2, √3/2). This means tangency, obtained via Lagrange multipliers: at the minimizing point, ∇(x/a + y/b) = λ ∇(a^2 + b^2), giving x/a^3 = y/b^3.
- Imposing tangency at (a,b) = (1/2, √3/2) yields x/(1/8) = y/(3√3/8), i.e., x = y/(3√3).
- Together with the AB line equation 2x + (2/√3) y = 1, we solve to get y = 3√3/8 and x = 1/8. Hence C = (1/8, 3√3/8).
- Then OC^2 = x^2 + y^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16, so p + q = 7 + 16 = 23.

### Proof Structure:
1. Model segments in F by intercepts (a,b) with a^2 + b^2 = 1; the segment’s line is x/a + y/b = 1.
2. A point lies on some F-segment iff there exist a,b>0 with a^2 + b^2 = 1 satisfying x/a + y/b = 1.
3. For uniqueness (only AB through C), require tangency of the level curve x/a + y/b = 1 to the circle a^2 + b^2 = 1 at (a,b) = (1/2, √3/2). Using Lagrange multipliers gives x/a^3 = y/b^3.
4. Solve x/a^3 = y/b^3 at (a,b) = (1/2, √3/2) to get x = y/(3√3).
5. Enforce that C is on AB: 2x + (2/√3) y = 1. Solve the system to obtain C = (1/8, 3√3/8).
6. Compute OC^2 = 7/16, hence p + q = 23.

- Family F: segments with endpoints P=(x,0), Q=(0,y), x>0, y>0, and length 1 ⇒ x^2 + y^2 = 1. The line is X/x + Y/y = 1.
- Segment AB has equation: X/(1/2) + Y/(√3/2) = 1 ⇒ 2X + (2/√3)Y = 1.
- A point (u,v) on AB lies on a segment of F with intercepts (x,y) iff u/x + v/y = 1 with x^2 + y^2 = 1.
- For (u,v) to lie only on AB (and no other F-segment), the solution (x,y) = (1/2, √3/2) must be a tangential (unique) solution under the constraint x^2 + y^2 = 1. By Lagrange multipliers: u/x^3 = v/y^3 at x=1/2, y=√3/2.
- Compute x^3 = (1/2)^3 = 1/8, y^3 = (√3/2)^3 = 3√3/8. Thus u/(1/8) = v/(3√3/8) ⇒ 8u = 8v/(3√3) ⇒ v = 3√3 u.
- With AB’s equation 2u + (2/√3)v = 1, substitute v = 3√3 u: 2u + (2/√3)(3√3 u) = 2u + 6u = 8u = 1 ⇒ u = 1/8. Then v = 3√3/8.
- OC^2 = u^2 + v^2 = (1/8)^2 + (3√3/8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. So p=7, q=16, p+q=23.

C0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: 
- The core modeling is sound: segments in F have endpoints P=(x,0), Q=(0,y) with x^2+y^2=1, and their lines are X/x + Y/y = 1. A point (u,v) on AB lies on a segment from F iff there exist x,y>0 with x^2+y^2=1 such that u/x + v/y = 1.
- However, one subtlety is not explicitly addressed: ensuring the point is on the finite segment (not just the infinite line). For points (u,v) with u,v≥0, the condition u/x + v/y = 1 automatically implies 0 ≤ u ≤ x and 0 ≤ v ≤ y, so the point indeed lies on the segment. This justification should be stated.
- The statement “uniqueness via tangency: gradients proportional, yielding u/x^3 = v/y^3 at (1/2, √3/2)” is conceptually correct (it’s the envelope/Lagrange multiplier condition), but it should be properly justified. One should show why uniqueness corresponds to a double root in the equation u/x + v/y = 1 along the unit circle x^2+y^2=1 (or equivalently f'(t0)=0 for t0 with x=cos t0, y=sin t0), or derive it cleanly via Lagrange multipliers.

### Corrections:
- Clarify segment vs line: For (u,v) in the first quadrant, if u/x + v/y = 1 with x,y>0, then u ≤ x and v ≤ y (since each term in the sum is nonnegative and their sum is 1), hence (u,v) lies on the segment between (x,0) and (0,y), not just the line.
- Justify uniqueness via tangency properly. Let t parametrize the family with x=cos t, y=sin t. For a fixed (u,v) on AB (which corresponds to t0 = π/3), define f(t) = u sec t + v csc t - 1. A point (u,v) lies on another segment in F iff there exists t ≠ t0 with f(t)=0. The unique point C on AB that lies on no other segment corresponds to t0 being a double root, i.e., f(t0)=0 and f'(t0)=0. This gives:
  - f'(t) = u sec t tan t - v csc t cot t; at t0=π/3, sec t0=2, tan t0=√3, csc t0=2/√3, cot t0=1/√3, so 2√3 u - (2/3) v = 0 ⇒ v = 3√3 u.
  - Along AB: 2u + (2/√3) v = 1. Substitute v to get 2u + (2/√3)(3√3 u) = 8u = 1 ⇒ u = 1/8, v = 3√3/8.
  - Then OC^2 = u^2 + v^2 = (1/64) + (27/64) = 28/64 = 7/16, so p+q = 7+16 = 23.

C0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: 
- Family F correctly modeled: endpoints P=(a,0), Q=(0,b) with a,b>0 and a^2+b^2=1. Each segment lies on line x/a + y/b = 1.
- Parameterization a=cos t, b=sin t (t in (0, π/2)) yields line family x sec t + y csc t = 1. Segment AB corresponds to t0=π/3 (since cos t0=1/2, sin t0=√3/2).
- A point on AB that lies on no other segment from F must correspond to a unique parameter t, i.e., f(t)=x sec t + y csc t − 1 has a double root at t0, which requires f’(t0)=0. This gives the tangency condition x sec t0 tan t0 − y csc t0 cot t0 = 0.
- With sec t0=2, csc t0=2/√3, tan t0=√3, cot t0=1/√3, the tangency condition becomes 2√3 x − (2/3) y = 0 ⇒ y = 3√3 x.
- Intersecting with AB (2x + (2/√3)y = 1) gives C=(1/8, 3√3/8).
- OC^2 = (1/8)^2 + (3√3/8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16, hence p+q=7+16=23.
- Cross-check: alternative condition u/a^3 = v/b^3 at a=1/2, b=√3/2 holds: (1/8)/(1/8)=1 and (3√3/8)/((3√3)/8)=1.

### Correctness Confirmation: 
The geometric modeling, tangency criterion, computations, and final value OC^2 = 7/16 are correct. The requested sum is 23.

- Parametrize family F by a = cosθ, b = sinθ (θ in (0, π/2)). Each segment has line x/a + y/b = 1, i.e., f(θ) = x secθ + y cscθ = 1.
- For a point to lie on only one such segment, f(θ) must attain its minimum at θ0 with value 1, so that equality holds only at θ0.
- AB corresponds to θ0 = π/3 (cosθ0 = 1/2, sinθ0 = √3/2). Thus the line is 2x + (2/√3)y = 1.
- Minimize f(θ): f'(θ) = 0 gives x sin^3θ = y cos^3θ ⇒ tanθ = (y/x)^(1/3).
- For uniqueness at θ0 = π/3, require (y/x)^(1/3) = tan(π/3) = √3 ⇒ y = 3√3 x.
- Substitute into AB: 2x + (2/√3)(3√3 x) = 2x + 6x = 8x = 1 ⇒ x = 1/8; hence y = 3√3/8.
- Compute OC^2 = x^2 + y^2 = (1/8)^2 + (3√3/8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.

C0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:
- Any unit segment with endpoints on the axes has intercepts (u, 0) and (0, v) with u^2 + v^2 = 1. Parametrize u = cosθ, v = sinθ for θ in (0, π/2). Its line is x/u + y/v = 1, i.e., x secθ + y cscθ = 1.
- For a fixed point (x, y) in the first quadrant, define f(θ) = x secθ + y cscθ. The point lies on such a unit segment iff f(θ) = 1 for some θ. The minimum of f occurs when tanθ = (y/x)^(1/3), and the minimum value is f_min = (x^(2/3) + y^(2/3))^(3/2).
- If f_min < 1, there are two segments through (x, y); if f_min = 1, exactly one; if f_min > 1, none.
- For point C on AB to lie on no unit segment other than AB, we must have f_min = 1 and the minimizing θ equal to AB’s θ. For AB, u = 1/2, v = √3/2, hence θ0 = π/3 and tanθ0 = √3. Thus (y/x)^(1/3) = √3 ⇒ y = 3√3 x.
- Since C lies on AB, it satisfies 2x + (2/√3) y = 1. Substituting y = 3√3 x gives 2x + 6x = 1 ⇒ x = 1/8, y = 3√3/8.
- Hence OC^2 = x^2 + y^2 = (1/64) + (27/64) = 7/16, so p + q = 7 + 16 = 23.

### Proof Structure:
1. Parametrize unit intercepts: (u, v) = (cosθ, sinθ) ⇒ line equation x secθ + y cscθ = 1.
2. For point (x, y), minimize f(θ) = x secθ + y cscθ:
   - Critical condition: tanθ = (y/x)^(1/3).
   - Minimum value: f_min = (x^(2/3) + y^(2/3))^(3/2).
3. Unique segment through (x, y) iff f_min = 1 and θ equals that segment’s θ.
4. For AB, θ0 = π/3, so (y/x)^(1/3) = √3 ⇒ y = 3√3 x. Together with 2x + (2/√3) y = 1, solve to get C = (1/8, 3√3/8).
5. Compute OC^2 = 7/16 ⇒ p + q = 23.

C0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: The parameterization of unit segments as lines x secθ + y cscθ = 1 with θ ∈ (0, π/2) is correct. The uniqueness condition for a point (x, y) to lie on exactly one such segment is correctly identified via tangency: minimizing f(θ) = x secθ + y cscθ gives tan^3θ = y/x. Imposing that the unique θ equals π/3 (the line AB) yields y = 3√3 x. Intersecting with AB (2x + (2/√3)y = 1) gives x = 1/8, y = 3√3/8.

A line from F through (u,v) satisfies u sec θ + v csc θ = 1. For points on AB, θ0 = π/3 (since A and B have (x,y) = (1/2, √3/2)) is always a solution. Uniqueness of the segment occurs when θ0 is a double root: g(θ) = u sec θ + v csc θ - 1 has g(π/3) = 0 and g'(π/3) = 0. Compute g'(θ) = u sec θ tan θ - v csc θ cot θ. At θ = π/3, sec tan = 2√3 and csc cot = 2/3, so 2√3 u - (2/3) v = 0 ⇒ v = 3√3 u. Intersect with AB (v = -√3 u + √3/2) gives u = 1/8, v = 3√3/8.
