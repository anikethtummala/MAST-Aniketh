The points D, E, C, F are collinear, and A, D, H, G lie on a common circle. Side lengths: AB=107, BC=16 for rectangle ABCD; EF=184, FG=17 for rectangle EFGH. The task is to find the integer length CE. A coordinate setup is natural: place ABCD axis-aligned with DC horizontal, then place E and F on line DC. For EFGH to be a rectangle with EF horizontal and FG vertical, G and H are vertically offset from the line DC by 17 units (either above or below). The cyclic condition on A, D, H, G imposes an equation linking the x-position t of E (and hence F) and the vertical offset y of G and H.\\n\\n### Key Information Summary: \\n- Set coordinates: A(0,0), B(107,0), C(107,16), D(0,16); DC is y=16.\\n- Let E(t,16), F(t+184,16) so EF=184 is horizontal.\\n- Rectangle EFGH implies FG vertical of length 17: y-coordinate of G,H is y=33 (above) or y=-1 (below).\\n- Circle through A and D has form x^2 + y^2 + u x - 16 y = 0. Imposing G,H on the circle yields the relation t(t+184) = y(y-16).\\n- Case y=33: y(y-16)=33·17=561 → t(t+184)=561 → t=3 or -187. Taking E between D and C (0≤t≤107) gives t=3.\\n- Hence CE = Cx − Ex = 107 − 3 = 104.\\n- Case y=-1 gives non-integer t and thus non-integer CE; the integer-consistent configuration is y=33 with CE=104.\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- Place rectangle ABCD with A(0,0), B(107,0), C(107,16), D(0,16) to match AB=107 and BC=16.\\n- Since D, E, C, F are collinear along DC (y=16), set E(t,16) and F(t+184,16) because EF=184 is horizontal.\\n- Rectangle EFGH has FG=17 vertical, so G and H have y = 16 ± 17, i.e., y = 33 or y = -1.\\n- Impose the cyclic condition that A, D, H, G lie on a circle.

Check: center (95, 8); A, D, H(3,33), G(187,33) all satisfy r^2 = 9089, so the concyclicity holds. The other orientation y_H = −1 gives non-integer and/or misordered solutions for E relative to D and C.\\n\\n### Correctness Confirmation: \\nAll geometric constraints are satisfied and CE is an integer. Final answer: 104.\\nC0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: \\n- Set ABCD with A(0,0), B(107,0), C(107,16), D(0,16). Since D,E,C, F are collinear, place E(x,16), F(x+184,16). For EFGH a rectangle with FG=17, G and H lie on y = 16 ± 17, i.e., y0 = 33 or y0 = -1.\\n- Circle through A(0,0) and D(0,16) has center (h,8). Concyclic condition for H(x, y0) and G(x+184, y0) gives:\\n  x^2 + 184x = (y0 - 8)^2 - 64.\\n- For y0 = 33: x^2 + 184x - 561 = 0 → discriminant 36100 → x = 3 or -187. The order D,E,C,F favors x = 3 (placing E between D and C). Then CE = 107 - 3 = 104.\\n- For y0 = -1: x^2 + 184x - 17 = 0 → non-integer roots, incompatible with the intended integer answer.\\n- Consistency check: With x=3, center h = 95; distances to A, D, G, H match, confirming concyclicity.\\n\\n### Corrections: \\n- No corrections needed.
