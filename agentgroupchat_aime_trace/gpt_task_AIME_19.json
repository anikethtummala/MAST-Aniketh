At most one chip per cell.\\n- Constraint: All chips in any given row must be the same color; same for columns. Rows/columns may be empty, but maximality forbids any further chip placement without violating constraints.\\n- Key structural implication: If a row (or column) has at least one chip, it has a well-defined color (W or B). Any occupied cell must lie at the intersection of a row and column of the same color; intersections of differently colored row/column must be empty.\\n- Maximality forces:\\n  - No empty row or column (otherwise we could add a chip consistent with an existing column/row color).\\n  - Every intersection of a white row with a white column and every intersection of a black row with a black column must be filled (otherwise we could add a chip there without violating constraints).\\n- Thus a maximal configuration is determined by choosing subsets of rows and columns to be white (with complements black), and filling exactly the blocks Rw×Cw and Rb×Cb. Supply limits are non-binding.\\n\\n### Key Information Summary: \\n- Let Rw ⊆ {rows} and Cw ⊆ {columns} be the white sets; Rb, Cb are their complements. In a maximal placement:\\n  - All cells in Rw×Cw and Rb×Cb are filled; all cells in Rw×Cb and Rb×Cw are empty.\\n  - No row/column is empty; hence either both colors appear in rows and columns, or everything is monochrome.\\n- Counting:\\n  - Monochrome cases: all rows and columns white (full 25 white chips) or all black: 2 configurations.\\n  - Mixed-color cases: choose Rw as any nonempty proper subset of rows (2^5−2=30 choices) and Cw similarly (30 choices), independently: 30×30=900 configurations.\\n- Total maximal placements: 2 + 900 = 902.\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- In any maximal placement, no row or column can be empty. Otherwise, one could add a chip without violating the row/column monochromatic condition.\\n- Classify each nonempty row and column by the color of its chips: rows and columns are either white or black.\\n- If a row and a column have the same color, their intersection can (and in a maximal placement, must) be filled with a chip of that color. If they have opposite colors, their intersection must be empty (placing any chip there would violate the monochromatic property for that row or column).\\n- Therefore, a maximal placement is uniquely determined by choosing:\\n  - A set Rw of white rows and its complement Rb of black rows,\\n  - A set Cw of white columns and its complement Cb of black columns,\\n  with the occupancy exactly Rw×Cw (white chips) and Rb×Cb (black chips).\\n- Nonemptiness constraints for maximality force:\\n  - Rw is nonempty iff Cw is nonempty (so each white row/column contains a chip),\\n  - Rb is nonempty iff Cb is nonempty (so each black row/column contains a chip).\\n- Counting:\\n  - If 1 ≤ |Rw| ≤ 4 and 1 ≤ |Cw| ≤ 4, choices are arbitrary: (2^5 − 2)^2 = 30^2 = 900.\\n  - Two boundary monochrome cases: all rows/columns white (all 25 white chips), and all rows/columns black (all 25 black chips), contribute 2 more.\\n- The 25-per-color supply is never binding (the grid has only 25 cells), so these constructions are feasible.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1.

At most one chip per cell.\\n- Constraint: All chips in any given row must be the same color; same for columns. Rows/columns may be empty, but maximality forbids any further chip placement without violating constraints.\\n- Key structural implication: If a row (or column) has at least one chip, it has a well-defined color (W or B). Any occupied cell must lie at the intersection of a row and column of the same color; intersections of differently colored row/column must be empty.\\n- Maximality forces:\\n  - No empty row or column (otherwise we could add a chip consistent with an existing column/row color).\\n  - Every intersection of a white row with a white column and every intersection of a black row with a black column must be filled (otherwise we could add a chip there without violating constraints).\\n- Thus a maximal configuration is determined by choosing subsets of rows and columns to be white (with complements black), and filling exactly the blocks Rw×Cw and Rb×Cb. Supply limits are non-binding.\\n\\n### Key Information Summary: \\n- Let Rw ⊆ {rows} and Cw ⊆ {columns} be the white sets; Rb, Cb are their complements. In a maximal placement:\\n  - All cells in Rw×Cw and Rb×Cb are filled; all cells in Rw×Cb and Rb×Cw are empty.\\n  - No row/column is empty; hence either both colors appear in rows and columns, or everything is monochrome.\\n- Counting:\\n  - Monochrome cases: all rows and columns white (full 25 white chips) or all black: 2 configurations.\\n  - Mixed-color cases: choose Rw as any nonempty proper subset of rows (2^5−2=30 choices) and Cw similarly (30 choices), independently: 30×30=900 configurations.\\n- Total maximal placements: 2 + 900 = 902.\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- In any maximal placement, no row or column can be empty. Otherwise, one could add a chip without violating the row/column monochromatic condition.\\n- Classify each nonempty row and column by the color of its chips: rows and columns are either white or black.\\n- If a row and a column have the same color, their intersection can (and in a maximal placement, must) be filled with a chip of that color. If they have opposite colors, their intersection must be empty (placing any chip there would violate the monochromatic property for that row or column).\\n- Therefore, a maximal placement is uniquely determined by choosing:\\n  - A set Rw of white rows and its complement Rb of black rows,\\n  - A set Cw of white columns and its complement Cb of black columns,\\n  with the occupancy exactly Rw×Cw (white chips) and Rb×Cb (black chips).\\n- Nonemptiness constraints for maximality force:\\n  - Rw is nonempty iff Cw is nonempty (so each white row/column contains a chip),\\n  - Rb is nonempty iff Cb is nonempty (so each black row/column contains a chip).\\n- Counting:\\n  - If 1 ≤ |Rw| ≤ 4 and 1 ≤ |Cw| ≤ 4, choices are arbitrary: (2^5 − 2)^2 = 30^2 = 900.\\n  - Two boundary monochrome cases: all rows/columns white (all 25 white chips), and all rows/columns black (all 25 black chips), contribute 2 more.\\n- The 25-per-color supply is never binding (the grid has only 25 cells), so these constructions are feasible.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Show maximality implies no empty row/column (otherwise a chip can be added without violating conditions).\\n2. Deduce rows/columns are colored (white/black) and same-color intersections must be filled; opposite-color intersections must be empty.\\n3. Conclude placements are exactly determined by subsets Rw ⊆ rows, Cw ⊆ columns, with occupancy Rw×Cw (white) ∪ (Rows\\\\Rw)×(Cols\\\\Cw) (black).\\n4. Enforce nonemptiness: Rw nonempty iff Cw nonempty; Rb nonempty iff Cb nonempty.\\n5. Count valid choices: (2^5−2)^2 = 900 plus 2 monochrome extremes, totaling 902.\\nC0004 say to All: ### Calculations: \\n- Let Rw be the set of rows containing white chips, Cw the set of columns containing white chips. Similarly, Rb and Cb for black.\\n- A chip at (row i, col j) can exist only if the row and column share the same color. For maximality, every intersection of same-colored row and column must be filled; otherwise, a chip could be added there without violating constraints.\\n- Maximality also requires no empty rows or columns; otherwise, a chip could be added at the intersection with an existing same-colored column/row.\\n- Therefore, valid maximal configurations come from:\\n  1) Mixed-color case: both colors appear in rows and columns. This means 1 ≤ |Rw| ≤ 4 and 1 ≤ |Cw| ≤ 4. Choices are independent, so count = (2^5 − 2) × (2^5 − 2) = 30 × 30 = 900.\\n  2) Monochrome case: only one color appears, and to avoid empty rows/columns the entire grid must be filled with that color. There are 2 such configurations (all white or all black).\\n- Supplies (25 white and 25 black) are not binding: in mixed cases each color uses at most 16 chips, and in monochrome full grid uses exactly 25 of that color.\\n\\nTotal maximal placements = 900 + 2 = 902.\\n\\n### Numerical Results: 902\\n\\nIn this chat turn, you can take up to 3 actions, currently on action 1.

At most one chip per cell.\\n- Constraint: All chips in any given row must be the same color; same for columns. Rows/columns may be empty, but maximality forbids any further chip placement without violating constraints.\\n- Key structural implication: If a row (or column) has at least one chip, it has a well-defined color (W or B). Any occupied cell must lie at the intersection of a row and column of the same color; intersections of differently colored row/column must be empty.\\n- Maximality forces:\\n  - No empty row or column (otherwise we could add a chip consistent with an existing column/row color).\\n  - Every intersection of a white row with a white column and every intersection of a black row with a black column must be filled (otherwise we could add a chip there without violating constraints).\\n- Thus a maximal configuration is determined by choosing subsets of rows and columns to be white (with complements black), and filling exactly the blocks Rw×Cw and Rb×Cb. Supply limits are non-binding.\\n\\n### Key Information Summary: \\n- Let Rw ⊆ {rows} and Cw ⊆ {columns} be the white sets; Rb, Cb are their complements. In a maximal placement:\\n  - All cells in Rw×Cw and Rb×Cb are filled; all cells in Rw×Cb and Rb×Cw are empty.\\n  - No row/column is empty; hence either both colors appear in rows and columns, or everything is monochrome.\\n- Counting:\\n  - Monochrome cases: all rows and columns white (full 25 white chips) or all black: 2 configurations.\\n  - Mixed-color cases: choose Rw as any nonempty proper subset of rows (2^5−2=30 choices) and Cw similarly (30 choices), independently: 30×30=900 configurations.\\n- Total maximal placements: 2 + 900 = 902.\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- In any maximal placement, no row or column can be empty. Otherwise, one could add a chip without violating the row/column monochromatic condition.\\n- Classify each nonempty row and column by the color of its chips: rows and columns are either white or black.\\n- If a row and a column have the same color, their intersection can (and in a maximal placement, must) be filled with a chip of that color. If they have opposite colors, their intersection must be empty (placing any chip there would violate the monochromatic property for that row or column).\\n- Therefore, a maximal placement is uniquely determined by choosing:\\n  - A set Rw of white rows and its complement Rb of black rows,\\n  - A set Cw of white columns and its complement Cb of black columns,\\n  with the occupancy exactly Rw×Cw (white chips) and Rb×Cb (black chips).\\n- Nonemptiness constraints for maximality force:\\n  - Rw is nonempty iff Cw is nonempty (so each white row/column contains a chip),\\n  - Rb is nonempty iff Cb is nonempty (so each black row/column contains a chip).\\n- Counting:\\n  - If 1 ≤ |Rw| ≤ 4 and 1 ≤ |Cw| ≤ 4, choices are arbitrary: (2^5 − 2)^2 = 30^2 = 900.\\n  - Two boundary monochrome cases: all rows/columns white (all 25 white chips), and all rows/columns black (all 25 black chips), contribute 2 more.\\n- The 25-per-color supply is never binding (the grid has only 25 cells), so these constructions are feasible.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Show maximality implies no empty row/column (otherwise a chip can be added without violating conditions).\\n2. Deduce rows/columns are colored (white/black) and same-color intersections must be filled; opposite-color intersections must be empty.\\n3. Conclude placements are exactly determined by subsets Rw ⊆ rows, Cw ⊆ columns, with occupancy Rw×Cw (white) ∪ (Rows\\\\Rw)×(Cols\\\\Cw) (black).\\n4. Enforce nonemptiness: Rw nonempty iff Cw nonempty; Rb nonempty iff Cb nonempty.\\n5. Count valid choices: (2^5−2)^2 = 900 plus 2 monochrome extremes, totaling 902.\\nC0004 say to All: ### Calculations: \\n- Let Rw be the set of rows containing white chips, Cw the set of columns containing white chips. Similarly, Rb and Cb for black.\\n- A chip at (row i, col j) can exist only if the row and column share the same color. For maximality, every intersection of same-colored row and column must be filled; otherwise, a chip could be added there without violating constraints.\\n- Maximality also requires no empty rows or columns; otherwise, a chip could be added at the intersection with an existing same-colored column/row.\\n- Therefore, valid maximal configurations come from:\\n  1) Mixed-color case: both colors appear in rows and columns. This means 1 ≤ |Rw| ≤ 4 and 1 ≤ |Cw| ≤ 4. Choices are independent, so count = (2^5 − 2) × (2^5 − 2) = 30 × 30 = 900.\\n  2) Monochrome case: only one color appears, and to avoid empty rows/columns the entire grid must be filled with that color. There are 2 such configurations (all white or all black).\\n- Supplies (25 white and 25 black) are not binding: in mixed cases each color uses at most 16 chips, and in monochrome full grid uses exactly 25 of that color.\\n\\nTotal maximal placements = 900 + 2 = 902.\\n\\n### Numerical Results: 902\\nC0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: The proposed counting approach models a maximal configuration by selecting sets of white rows (Rw) and white columns (Cw), filling exactly Rw×Cw with white chips and the complement Rb×Cb with black chips, leaving opposite-color intersections empty.

At most one chip per cell.\\n- Constraint: All chips in any given row must be the same color; same for columns. Rows/columns may be empty, but maximality forbids any further chip placement without violating constraints.\\n- Key structural implication: If a row (or column) has at least one chip, it has a well-defined color (W or B). Any occupied cell must lie at the intersection of a row and column of the same color; intersections of differently colored row/column must be empty.\\n- Maximality forces:\\n  - No empty row or column (otherwise we could add a chip consistent with an existing column/row color).\\n  - Every intersection of a white row with a white column and every intersection of a black row with a black column must be filled (otherwise we could add a chip there without violating constraints).\\n- Thus a maximal configuration is determined by choosing subsets of rows and columns to be white (with complements black), and filling exactly the blocks Rw×Cw and Rb×Cb. Supply limits are non-binding.\\n\\n### Key Information Summary: \\n- Let Rw ⊆ {rows} and Cw ⊆ {columns} be the white sets; Rb, Cb are their complements. In a maximal placement:\\n  - All cells in Rw×Cw and Rb×Cb are filled; all cells in Rw×Cb and Rb×Cw are empty.\\n  - No row/column is empty; hence either both colors appear in rows and columns, or everything is monochrome.\\n- Counting:\\n  - Monochrome cases: all rows and columns white (full 25 white chips) or all black: 2 configurations.\\n  - Mixed-color cases: choose Rw as any nonempty proper subset of rows (2^5−2=30 choices) and Cw similarly (30 choices), independently: 30×30=900 configurations.\\n- Total maximal placements: 2 + 900 = 902.\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- In any maximal placement, no row or column can be empty. Otherwise, one could add a chip without violating the row/column monochromatic condition.\\n- Classify each nonempty row and column by the color of its chips: rows and columns are either white or black.\\n- If a row and a column have the same color, their intersection can (and in a maximal placement, must) be filled with a chip of that color. If they have opposite colors, their intersection must be empty (placing any chip there would violate the monochromatic property for that row or column).\\n- Therefore, a maximal placement is uniquely determined by choosing:\\n  - A set Rw of white rows and its complement Rb of black rows,\\n  - A set Cw of white columns and its complement Cb of black columns,\\n  with the occupancy exactly Rw×Cw (white chips) and Rb×Cb (black chips).\\n- Nonemptiness constraints for maximality force:\\n  - Rw is nonempty iff Cw is nonempty (so each white row/column contains a chip),\\n  - Rb is nonempty iff Cb is nonempty (so each black row/column contains a chip).\\n- Counting:\\n  - If 1 ≤ |Rw| ≤ 4 and 1 ≤ |Cw| ≤ 4, choices are arbitrary: (2^5 − 2)^2 = 30^2 = 900.\\n  - Two boundary monochrome cases: all rows/columns white (all 25 white chips), and all rows/columns black (all 25 black chips), contribute 2 more.\\n- The 25-per-color supply is never binding (the grid has only 25 cells), so these constructions are feasible.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Show maximality implies no empty row/column (otherwise a chip can be added without violating conditions).\\n2. Deduce rows/columns are colored (white/black) and same-color intersections must be filled; opposite-color intersections must be empty.\\n3. Conclude placements are exactly determined by subsets Rw ⊆ rows, Cw ⊆ columns, with occupancy Rw×Cw (white) ∪ (Rows\\\\Rw)×(Cols\\\\Cw) (black).\\n4. Enforce nonemptiness: Rw nonempty iff Cw nonempty; Rb nonempty iff Cb nonempty.\\n5. Count valid choices: (2^5−2)^2 = 900 plus 2 monochrome extremes, totaling 902.\\nC0004 say to All: ### Calculations: \\n- Let Rw be the set of rows containing white chips, Cw the set of columns containing white chips. Similarly, Rb and Cb for black.\\n- A chip at (row i, col j) can exist only if the row and column share the same color. For maximality, every intersection of same-colored row and column must be filled; otherwise, a chip could be added there without violating constraints.\\n- Maximality also requires no empty rows or columns; otherwise, a chip could be added at the intersection with an existing same-colored column/row.\\n- Therefore, valid maximal configurations come from:\\n  1) Mixed-color case: both colors appear in rows and columns. This means 1 ≤ |Rw| ≤ 4 and 1 ≤ |Cw| ≤ 4. Choices are independent, so count = (2^5 − 2) × (2^5 − 2) = 30 × 30 = 900.\\n  2) Monochrome case: only one color appears, and to avoid empty rows/columns the entire grid must be filled with that color. There are 2 such configurations (all white or all black).\\n- Supplies (25 white and 25 black) are not binding: in mixed cases each color uses at most 16 chips, and in monochrome full grid uses exactly 25 of that color.\\n\\nTotal maximal placements = 900 + 2 = 902.\\n\\n### Numerical Results: 902\\nC0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: The proposed counting approach models a maximal configuration by selecting sets of white rows (Rw) and white columns (Cw), filling exactly Rw×Cw with white chips and the complement Rb×Cb with black chips, leaving opposite-color intersections empty. The claim that maximality forces:\\n- no empty rows or columns, unless all rows/columns are of a single color (all-white or all-black), and\\n- all same-color row/column intersections to be filled,\\nis correct. This ensures each empty cell lies at a white-row/black-column or black-row/white-column intersection, where adding any chip would violate row/column monochromaticity.\\n\\nThe necessary and sufficient conditions deduced for maximality are:\\n- either 1 ≤ r = |Rw| ≤ 4 and 1 ≤ c = |Cw| ≤ 4, or\\n- r = c = 0 (all black), or\\n- r = c = 5 (all white).\\n\\nCounting choices gives sum_{r=1..4} C(5,r) × sum_{c=1..4} C(5,c) + 1 + 1 = 30×30 + 2 = 902. No logical or computational errors were found.\\n\\n### Corrections: None. The final count 902 is correct.\\nC0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: \\n- Under the row/column monochromatic condition, each nonempty row and column is assigned a color (W or B).

Conclude placements are exactly determined by subsets Rw ⊆ rows, Cw ⊆ columns, with occupancy Rw×Cw (white) ∪ (Rows\\\\Rw)×(Cols\\\\Cw) (black).\\n4. Enforce nonemptiness: Rw nonempty iff Cw nonempty; Rb nonempty iff Cb nonempty.\\n5. Count valid choices: (2^5−2)^2 = 900 plus 2 monochrome extremes, totaling 902.\\nC0004 say to All: ### Calculations: \\n- Let Rw be the set of rows containing white chips, Cw the set of columns containing white chips. Similarly, Rb and Cb for black.\\n- A chip at (row i, col j) can exist only if the row and column share the same color. For maximality, every intersection of same-colored row and column must be filled; otherwise, a chip could be added there without violating constraints.\\n- Maximality also requires no empty rows or columns; otherwise, a chip could be added at the intersection with an existing same-colored column/row.\\n- Therefore, valid maximal configurations come from:\\n  1) Mixed-color case: both colors appear in rows and columns. This means 1 ≤ |Rw| ≤ 4 and 1 ≤ |Cw| ≤ 4. Choices are independent, so count = (2^5 − 2) × (2^5 − 2) = 30 × 30 = 900.\\n  2) Monochrome case: only one color appears, and to avoid empty rows/columns the entire grid must be filled with that color. There are 2 such configurations (all white or all black).\\n- Supplies (25 white and 25 black) are not binding: in mixed cases each color uses at most 16 chips, and in monochrome full grid uses exactly 25 of that color.\\n\\nTotal maximal placements = 900 + 2 = 902.\\n\\n### Numerical Results: 902\\nC0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: The proposed counting approach models a maximal configuration by selecting sets of white rows (Rw) and white columns (Cw), filling exactly Rw×Cw with white chips and the complement Rb×Cb with black chips, leaving opposite-color intersections empty. The claim that maximality forces:\\n- no empty rows or columns, unless all rows/columns are of a single color (all-white or all-black), and\\n- all same-color row/column intersections to be filled,\\nis correct. This ensures each empty cell lies at a white-row/black-column or black-row/white-column intersection, where adding any chip would violate row/column monochromaticity.\\n\\nThe necessary and sufficient conditions deduced for maximality are:\\n- either 1 ≤ r = |Rw| ≤ 4 and 1 ≤ c = |Cw| ≤ 4, or\\n- r = c = 0 (all black), or\\n- r = c = 5 (all white).\\n\\nCounting choices gives sum_{r=1..4} C(5,r) × sum_{c=1..4} C(5,c) + 1 + 1 = 30×30 + 2 = 902. No logical or computational errors were found.\\n\\n### Corrections: None. The final count 902 is correct.\\nC0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: \\n- Under the row/column monochromatic condition, each nonempty row and column is assigned a color (W or B). Consistency requires that a cell (row i, column j) can contain a chip if and only if the row and column colors match; otherwise it must be empty.\\n- Maximality forces:\\n  - No empty rows or columns (otherwise you could add a chip without violating monochromaticity).\\n  - Every same-color row/column intersection must be filled (otherwise you could add a chip there).\\n- Therefore, a maximal configuration is uniquely determined by choosing the set RW of white rows and CW of white columns, with the board filled exactly at RW×CW (white chips) and RB×CB (black chips), where RB, CB are complements.\\n- To avoid empty rows/columns:\\n  - If both RW and CW are nonempty proper subsets, all rows and columns are nonempty.\\n  - The two additional valid extremes are the full all-white grid (RW = all rows, CW = all columns) and the full all-black grid (RW = ∅, CW = ∅).\\n- Counting:\\n  - Choose RW and CW as nonempty proper subsets: (2^5 − 2)^2 = 30^2 = 900.\\n  - Add the two monochrome full grids: +2.\\n  - Total = 900 + 2 = 902.\\n- Chip supply (25 of each color) is never a binding constraint since at most 25 chips are placed.\\n\\n### Correctness Confirmation: 902\\n\\nPlease summarize the key content from the group chat messages:\", \"model_response\": {\"message\": \"- Structure of maximal placements:\\n  - Assign each nonempty row and column a color (white or black).

A cell can be occupied only if its row and column have the same color; opposite-color intersections must be empty.\\n  - Maximality implies:\\n    - No row or column is empty (except in the fully monochrome cases).\\n    - Every same-color row/column intersection must be filled; otherwise, a chip could be added.\\n  - Thus a configuration is determined by choosing the set of white rows RW and white columns CW, filling exactly RW×CW with white chips and (complements) RB×CB with black chips.\\n\\n- Counting:\\n  - Mixed-color cases: choose RW and CW as nonempty proper subsets of the 5 rows/columns independently: (2^5 − 2)^2 = 30^2 = 900.\\n  - Monochrome cases: all-white full grid or all-black full grid: 2 configurations.\\n  - Total maximal placements: 900 + 2 = 902.\\n\\n- Chip supply is not a constraint (grid has 25 cells).\\nC0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: \\n- In any placement satisfying the row/column monochromatic condition, each row and column that contains chips is assigned a single color (white or black).  \\n- In a maximal configuration, there can be no empty rows or columns: if a row (or column) were empty, one could add a chip of the existing color from some nonempty column (or row) without violating any condition, contradicting maximality.\\n- Therefore, each row is either a white row or a black row, and each column is either a white column or a black column.  \\n- Maximality further forces:\\n  - Every intersection of a white row and a white column must contain a white chip (otherwise we could add it).\\n  - Every intersection of a black row and a black column must contain a black chip.\\n  - Intersections of rows and columns of opposite colors must be empty (no chip color can satisfy both).\\n- Hence each maximal configuration is uniquely determined by the choice of a nonempty subset RW of rows designated white and a nonempty subset CW of columns designated white, with all of RW×CW filled white and RB×CB (complements) filled black.\\n- To avoid empty rows/columns, in the mixed-color case both RW and RB must be nonempty (so RW is a nonempty proper subset), and similarly CW and CB must be nonempty (CW a nonempty proper subset).\\n- This yields (2^5 − 2) choices for RW and (2^5 − 2) choices for CW, giving 30×30 = 900 mixed-color maximal configurations.\\n- Additionally, there are two monochromatic maximal configurations: all 25 white chips (RW = all rows, CW = all columns) and all 25 black chips.\\n- Total maximal configurations: 900 + 2 = 902. The chip supply constraints (≤25 of each color) are never exceeded.\\n\\n### Correctness Confirmation: 902\\nC0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: The derivation is consistent.

A cell can be occupied only if its row and column have the same color; opposite-color intersections must be empty.\\n  - Maximality implies:\\n    - No row or column is empty (except in the fully monochrome cases).\\n    - Every same-color row/column intersection must be filled; otherwise, a chip could be added.\\n  - Thus a configuration is determined by choosing the set of white rows RW and white columns CW, filling exactly RW×CW with white chips and (complements) RB×CB with black chips.\\n\\n- Counting:\\n  - Mixed-color cases: choose RW and CW as nonempty proper subsets of the 5 rows/columns independently: (2^5 − 2)^2 = 30^2 = 900.\\n  - Monochrome cases: all-white full grid or all-black full grid: 2 configurations.\\n  - Total maximal placements: 900 + 2 = 902.\\n\\n- Chip supply is not a constraint (grid has 25 cells).\\nC0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: \\n- In any placement satisfying the row/column monochromatic condition, each row and column that contains chips is assigned a single color (white or black).  \\n- In a maximal configuration, there can be no empty rows or columns: if a row (or column) were empty, one could add a chip of the existing color from some nonempty column (or row) without violating any condition, contradicting maximality.\\n- Therefore, each row is either a white row or a black row, and each column is either a white column or a black column.  \\n- Maximality further forces:\\n  - Every intersection of a white row and a white column must contain a white chip (otherwise we could add it).\\n  - Every intersection of a black row and a black column must contain a black chip.\\n  - Intersections of rows and columns of opposite colors must be empty (no chip color can satisfy both).\\n- Hence each maximal configuration is uniquely determined by the choice of a nonempty subset RW of rows designated white and a nonempty subset CW of columns designated white, with all of RW×CW filled white and RB×CB (complements) filled black.\\n- To avoid empty rows/columns, in the mixed-color case both RW and RB must be nonempty (so RW is a nonempty proper subset), and similarly CW and CB must be nonempty (CW a nonempty proper subset).\\n- This yields (2^5 − 2) choices for RW and (2^5 − 2) choices for CW, giving 30×30 = 900 mixed-color maximal configurations.\\n- Additionally, there are two monochromatic maximal configurations: all 25 white chips (RW = all rows, CW = all columns) and all 25 black chips.\\n- Total maximal configurations: 900 + 2 = 902. The chip supply constraints (≤25 of each color) are never exceeded.\\n\\n### Correctness Confirmation: 902\\nC0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: The derivation is consistent. Maximality implies every row and column is nonempty and that occupied cells are exactly those where row and column colors match. Configurations correspond to choosing nonempty proper subsets of rows and columns for one color, giving (2^5−2)^2 = 900, plus two monochrome full grids, totaling 902. No counting or logical errors found.\\n### Corrections: 902\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- Let Rw, Rb, R0 be the sets of rows containing only white chips, only black chips, and no chips, respectively. Similarly define Cw, Cb, C0 for columns.\\n- Any placed chip must lie in Rw×Cw (white) or Rb×Cb (black), and no cell in Rw×Cb or Rb×Cw can contain a chip.\\n- Maximality requires that no additional chip can be added without violating monochromatic rows/columns. This forces:\\n  - No empty row and empty column simultaneously (else their intersection accepts a chip).\\n  - In fact, stronger: R0=∅ and C0=∅. If C0≠∅ and Rw or Rb nonempty, a chip can be added in Rw×C0 or Rb×C0. With C0 empty, if R0≠∅, then for any nonempty column (which must be either white or black), a matching color chip can be added in that empty row, contradiction. Hence both must be empty.\\n  - For maximality, all cells in Rw×Cw and in Rb×Cb must be filled; otherwise one could add a chip there without violating constraints.\\n- Thus a maximal configuration is determined by choosing:\\n  - r=|Rw| rows to be white and 5−r rows to be black (with 0≤r≤5),\\n  - c=|Cw| columns to be white and 5−c columns to be black,\\n  subject to:\\n  - r=0 iff c=0 (all black), and r=5 iff c=5 (all white); otherwise 1≤r≤4 and 1≤c≤4.\\n- For each valid (r,c), the placement is uniquely determined: fill Rw×Cw with white and Rb×Cb with black; other cells empty.

A cell can be occupied only if its row and column have the same color; opposite-color intersections must be empty.\\n  - Maximality implies:\\n    - No row or column is empty (except in the fully monochrome cases).\\n    - Every same-color row/column intersection must be filled; otherwise, a chip could be added.\\n  - Thus a configuration is determined by choosing the set of white rows RW and white columns CW, filling exactly RW×CW with white chips and (complements) RB×CB with black chips.\\n\\n- Counting:\\n  - Mixed-color cases: choose RW and CW as nonempty proper subsets of the 5 rows/columns independently: (2^5 − 2)^2 = 30^2 = 900.\\n  - Monochrome cases: all-white full grid or all-black full grid: 2 configurations.\\n  - Total maximal placements: 900 + 2 = 902.\\n\\n- Chip supply is not a constraint (grid has 25 cells).\\nC0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: \\n- In any placement satisfying the row/column monochromatic condition, each row and column that contains chips is assigned a single color (white or black).  \\n- In a maximal configuration, there can be no empty rows or columns: if a row (or column) were empty, one could add a chip of the existing color from some nonempty column (or row) without violating any condition, contradicting maximality.\\n- Therefore, each row is either a white row or a black row, and each column is either a white column or a black column.  \\n- Maximality further forces:\\n  - Every intersection of a white row and a white column must contain a white chip (otherwise we could add it).\\n  - Every intersection of a black row and a black column must contain a black chip.\\n  - Intersections of rows and columns of opposite colors must be empty (no chip color can satisfy both).\\n- Hence each maximal configuration is uniquely determined by the choice of a nonempty subset RW of rows designated white and a nonempty subset CW of columns designated white, with all of RW×CW filled white and RB×CB (complements) filled black.\\n- To avoid empty rows/columns, in the mixed-color case both RW and RB must be nonempty (so RW is a nonempty proper subset), and similarly CW and CB must be nonempty (CW a nonempty proper subset).\\n- This yields (2^5 − 2) choices for RW and (2^5 − 2) choices for CW, giving 30×30 = 900 mixed-color maximal configurations.\\n- Additionally, there are two monochromatic maximal configurations: all 25 white chips (RW = all rows, CW = all columns) and all 25 black chips.\\n- Total maximal configurations: 900 + 2 = 902. The chip supply constraints (≤25 of each color) are never exceeded.\\n\\n### Correctness Confirmation: 902\\nC0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: The derivation is consistent. Maximality implies every row and column is nonempty and that occupied cells are exactly those where row and column colors match. Configurations correspond to choosing nonempty proper subsets of rows and columns for one color, giving (2^5−2)^2 = 900, plus two monochrome full grids, totaling 902. No counting or logical errors found.\\n### Corrections: 902\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- Let Rw, Rb, R0 be the sets of rows containing only white chips, only black chips, and no chips, respectively. Similarly define Cw, Cb, C0 for columns.\\n- Any placed chip must lie in Rw×Cw (white) or Rb×Cb (black), and no cell in Rw×Cb or Rb×Cw can contain a chip.\\n- Maximality requires that no additional chip can be added without violating monochromatic rows/columns. This forces:\\n  - No empty row and empty column simultaneously (else their intersection accepts a chip).\\n  - In fact, stronger: R0=∅ and C0=∅. If C0≠∅ and Rw or Rb nonempty, a chip can be added in Rw×C0 or Rb×C0. With C0 empty, if R0≠∅, then for any nonempty column (which must be either white or black), a matching color chip can be added in that empty row, contradiction. Hence both must be empty.\\n  - For maximality, all cells in Rw×Cw and in Rb×Cb must be filled; otherwise one could add a chip there without violating constraints.\\n- Thus a maximal configuration is determined by choosing:\\n  - r=|Rw| rows to be white and 5−r rows to be black (with 0≤r≤5),\\n  - c=|Cw| columns to be white and 5−c columns to be black,\\n  subject to:\\n  - r=0 iff c=0 (all black), and r=5 iff c=5 (all white); otherwise 1≤r≤4 and 1≤c≤4.\\n- For each valid (r,c), the placement is uniquely determined: fill Rw×Cw with white and Rb×Cb with black; other cells empty. This uses at most 25 of each color, so chip supplies are sufficient.\\n\\nCounting:\\n- For 1≤r≤4 and 1≤c≤4: number of choices is (sum_{r=1}^4 C(5,r))·(sum_{c=1}^4 C(5,c)) = 30·30 = 900.\\n- Add the two extreme cases: (r,c)=(0,0) (all black) and (5,5) (all white), yielding +2.\\n- Total = 900 + 2 = 902.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Define row/column color classes Rw, Rb, R0 and Cw, Cb, C0 induced by a placement.\\n2. Show that any chip must lie in Rw×Cw (white) or Rb×Cb (black); mixed quadrants are forbidden.\\n3. Prove maximality implies R0=∅ and C0=∅:\\n   - If R0 and C0 both nonempty, add a chip at their intersection.\\n   - If C0 nonempty and either Rw or Rb nonempty, add a chip in Rw×C0 or Rb×C0.\\n   - With C0=∅, if R0 nonempty, add a chip in any column of matching color → contradiction.\\n4. Prove maximality forces Rw×Cw and Rb×Cb to be completely filled; otherwise, a chip could be added there.\\n5. Conclude placements are characterized by choosing r=|Rw| and c=|Cw| with:\\n   - Either (r,c)=(0,0) (all black) or (r,c)=(5,5) (all white), or 1≤r≤4 and 1≤c≤4.\\n6. Count configurations:\\n   - For 1≤r≤4 and 1≤c≤4: sum C(5,r)·C(5,c) = (32−2)·(32−2) = 30·30 = 900.\\n   - Add 2 extreme cases ⇒ total 902.\\nC0004 say to All: ### Calculations: \\n- For maximality, every row and every column must contain at least one chip; otherwise, a chip can be added without violating constraints.\\n- Assign a color (W or B) to each row and each column.

The chip supply constraints (≤25 of each color) are never exceeded.\\n\\n### Correctness Confirmation: 902\\nC0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: The derivation is consistent. Maximality implies every row and column is nonempty and that occupied cells are exactly those where row and column colors match. Configurations correspond to choosing nonempty proper subsets of rows and columns for one color, giving (2^5−2)^2 = 900, plus two monochrome full grids, totaling 902. No counting or logical errors found.\\n### Corrections: 902\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- Let Rw, Rb, R0 be the sets of rows containing only white chips, only black chips, and no chips, respectively. Similarly define Cw, Cb, C0 for columns.\\n- Any placed chip must lie in Rw×Cw (white) or Rb×Cb (black), and no cell in Rw×Cb or Rb×Cw can contain a chip.\\n- Maximality requires that no additional chip can be added without violating monochromatic rows/columns. This forces:\\n  - No empty row and empty column simultaneously (else their intersection accepts a chip).\\n  - In fact, stronger: R0=∅ and C0=∅. If C0≠∅ and Rw or Rb nonempty, a chip can be added in Rw×C0 or Rb×C0. With C0 empty, if R0≠∅, then for any nonempty column (which must be either white or black), a matching color chip can be added in that empty row, contradiction. Hence both must be empty.\\n  - For maximality, all cells in Rw×Cw and in Rb×Cb must be filled; otherwise one could add a chip there without violating constraints.\\n- Thus a maximal configuration is determined by choosing:\\n  - r=|Rw| rows to be white and 5−r rows to be black (with 0≤r≤5),\\n  - c=|Cw| columns to be white and 5−c columns to be black,\\n  subject to:\\n  - r=0 iff c=0 (all black), and r=5 iff c=5 (all white); otherwise 1≤r≤4 and 1≤c≤4.\\n- For each valid (r,c), the placement is uniquely determined: fill Rw×Cw with white and Rb×Cb with black; other cells empty. This uses at most 25 of each color, so chip supplies are sufficient.\\n\\nCounting:\\n- For 1≤r≤4 and 1≤c≤4: number of choices is (sum_{r=1}^4 C(5,r))·(sum_{c=1}^4 C(5,c)) = 30·30 = 900.\\n- Add the two extreme cases: (r,c)=(0,0) (all black) and (5,5) (all white), yielding +2.\\n- Total = 900 + 2 = 902.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Define row/column color classes Rw, Rb, R0 and Cw, Cb, C0 induced by a placement.\\n2. Show that any chip must lie in Rw×Cw (white) or Rb×Cb (black); mixed quadrants are forbidden.\\n3. Prove maximality implies R0=∅ and C0=∅:\\n   - If R0 and C0 both nonempty, add a chip at their intersection.\\n   - If C0 nonempty and either Rw or Rb nonempty, add a chip in Rw×C0 or Rb×C0.\\n   - With C0=∅, if R0 nonempty, add a chip in any column of matching color → contradiction.\\n4. Prove maximality forces Rw×Cw and Rb×Cb to be completely filled; otherwise, a chip could be added there.\\n5. Conclude placements are characterized by choosing r=|Rw| and c=|Cw| with:\\n   - Either (r,c)=(0,0) (all black) or (r,c)=(5,5) (all white), or 1≤r≤4 and 1≤c≤4.\\n6. Count configurations:\\n   - For 1≤r≤4 and 1≤c≤4: sum C(5,r)·C(5,c) = (32−2)·(32−2) = 30·30 = 900.\\n   - Add 2 extreme cases ⇒ total 902.\\nC0004 say to All: ### Calculations: \\n- For maximality, every row and every column must contain at least one chip; otherwise, a chip can be added without violating constraints.\\n- Assign a color (W or B) to each row and each column. In a maximal configuration, the occupied cells are exactly those where the row and column colors match; all such cells must be filled.\\n- To ensure each row and column has at least one chip, both colors must appear among the rows and among the columns, or the entire grid is monochromatic (all W or all B).\\n- Count:\\n  - Nonconstant row colorings: 2^5 - 2 = 30.

A placement is maximal if no additional chip can be added without violating these constraints.\\n\\nThis implies:\\n- If a cell has a chip, its row and column must share that chip’s color.\\n- For maximality, no empty row or column can exist; otherwise, a chip could be added consistently.\\n- For any row and column of the same color, their intersection must be occupied; otherwise, a chip could be added there.\\n\\nThus, maximal configurations are exactly those obtained by:\\n- Choosing a subset W_R of rows to be white (size r) and a subset W_C of columns to be white (size c).\\n- Filling all cells in W_R × W_C with white chips and all cells in B_R × B_C (complements) with black chips, leaving the cross blocks empty.\\n- Ensuring every row and column has at least one chip, which translates to allowed (r, c) pairs: (0,0), (5,5), or r,c ∈ {1,2,3,4}.\\n\\nThe supply limits (25 of each color) are non-binding since placements use at most 25 chips total and each color’s count is r·c or (5−r)(5−c) ≤ 25.\\n\\n### Key Information Summary:\\n- Model maximal placements by partitioning rows and columns into white/black sets: sizes r and c.\\n- Valid (r, c): (0,0), (5,5), or r,c ∈ {1,2,3,4}.\\n- For each valid (r, c), number of placements = C(5,r)·C(5,c), uniquely determined by filled rectangles.\\n- Total count = C(5,0)C(5,0) + C(5,5)C(5,5) + [sum_{r=1..4} C(5,r)] · [sum_{c=1..4} C(5,c)]\\n- Compute: sum_{1..4} C(5,·) = 32 − 2 = 30, so total = 1 + 1 + 30·30 = 902.\\n\\nOutput requirements:\\n1.

The chip supply constraints (≤25 of each color) are never exceeded.\\n\\n### Correctness Confirmation: 902\\nC0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: The derivation is consistent. Maximality implies every row and column is nonempty and that occupied cells are exactly those where row and column colors match. Configurations correspond to choosing nonempty proper subsets of rows and columns for one color, giving (2^5−2)^2 = 900, plus two monochrome full grids, totaling 902. No counting or logical errors found.\\n### Corrections: 902\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- Let Rw, Rb, R0 be the sets of rows containing only white chips, only black chips, and no chips, respectively. Similarly define Cw, Cb, C0 for columns.\\n- Any placed chip must lie in Rw×Cw (white) or Rb×Cb (black), and no cell in Rw×Cb or Rb×Cw can contain a chip.\\n- Maximality requires that no additional chip can be added without violating monochromatic rows/columns. This forces:\\n  - No empty row and empty column simultaneously (else their intersection accepts a chip).\\n  - In fact, stronger: R0=∅ and C0=∅. If C0≠∅ and Rw or Rb nonempty, a chip can be added in Rw×C0 or Rb×C0. With C0 empty, if R0≠∅, then for any nonempty column (which must be either white or black), a matching color chip can be added in that empty row, contradiction. Hence both must be empty.\\n  - For maximality, all cells in Rw×Cw and in Rb×Cb must be filled; otherwise one could add a chip there without violating constraints.\\n- Thus a maximal configuration is determined by choosing:\\n  - r=|Rw| rows to be white and 5−r rows to be black (with 0≤r≤5),\\n  - c=|Cw| columns to be white and 5−c columns to be black,\\n  subject to:\\n  - r=0 iff c=0 (all black), and r=5 iff c=5 (all white); otherwise 1≤r≤4 and 1≤c≤4.\\n- For each valid (r,c), the placement is uniquely determined: fill Rw×Cw with white and Rb×Cb with black; other cells empty. This uses at most 25 of each color, so chip supplies are sufficient.\\n\\nCounting:\\n- For 1≤r≤4 and 1≤c≤4: number of choices is (sum_{r=1}^4 C(5,r))·(sum_{c=1}^4 C(5,c)) = 30·30 = 900.\\n- Add the two extreme cases: (r,c)=(0,0) (all black) and (5,5) (all white), yielding +2.\\n- Total = 900 + 2 = 902.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Define row/column color classes Rw, Rb, R0 and Cw, Cb, C0 induced by a placement.\\n2. Show that any chip must lie in Rw×Cw (white) or Rb×Cb (black); mixed quadrants are forbidden.\\n3. Prove maximality implies R0=∅ and C0=∅:\\n   - If R0 and C0 both nonempty, add a chip at their intersection.\\n   - If C0 nonempty and either Rw or Rb nonempty, add a chip in Rw×C0 or Rb×C0.\\n   - With C0=∅, if R0 nonempty, add a chip in any column of matching color → contradiction.\\n4. Prove maximality forces Rw×Cw and Rb×Cb to be completely filled; otherwise, a chip could be added there.\\n5. Conclude placements are characterized by choosing r=|Rw| and c=|Cw| with:\\n   - Either (r,c)=(0,0) (all black) or (r,c)=(5,5) (all white), or 1≤r≤4 and 1≤c≤4.\\n6. Count configurations:\\n   - For 1≤r≤4 and 1≤c≤4: sum C(5,r)·C(5,c) = (32−2)·(32−2) = 30·30 = 900.\\n   - Add 2 extreme cases ⇒ total 902.\\nC0004 say to All: ### Calculations: \\n- For maximality, every row and every column must contain at least one chip; otherwise, a chip can be added without violating constraints.\\n- Assign a color (W or B) to each row and each column. In a maximal configuration, the occupied cells are exactly those where the row and column colors match; all such cells must be filled.\\n- To ensure each row and column has at least one chip, both colors must appear among the rows and among the columns, or the entire grid is monochromatic (all W or all B).\\n- Count:\\n  - Nonconstant row colorings: 2^5 - 2 = 30.
