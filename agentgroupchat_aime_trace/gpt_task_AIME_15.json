For an odd prime p to divide n^4 + 1, we require -1 to be a fourth power modulo p, which happens iff p ≡ 1 (mod 8). For lifting a root modulo p to a root modulo p^2, use Hensel’s lemma: if f(x) = x^4 + 1, and f(x0) ≡ 0 (mod p) with f′(x0) = 4x0^3 not ≡ 0 (mod p), then there is a unique lift x ≡ x0 (mod p) solving f(x) ≡ 0 (mod p^2). The smallest such prime is p = 17. We then find all roots x0 modulo 17 of x^4 ≡ -1 and lift each to modulo 289 to determine the smallest positive representative m with 289 | m^4 + 1.\\n\\n### Key Information Summary:\\n- p must be ≡ 1 (mod 8); the smallest such prime is p = 17.\\n- Solve x^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17): the roots are x ≡ ±2, ±8 (i.e., 2, 15, 8, 9).\\n- Lift each root x0 via m = x0 + 17k using f(x0 + 17k) ≡ 17(1 + 4x0^3 k) (mod 289) and solve 1 + 4x0^3 k ≡ 0 (mod 17):\\n  - x0 = 2: 4x0^3 ≡ 32 ≡ 15 ⇒ k ≡ 9 ⇒ m ≡ 155 (mod 289)\\n  - x0 = 15: 4x0^3 ≡ 2 ⇒ k ≡ 8 ⇒ m ≡ 151 (mod 289)\\n  - x0 = 8: 4x0^3 ≡ 8 ⇒ k ≡ 2 ⇒ m ≡ 42 (mod 289)\\n  - x0 = 9: 4x0^3 ≡ 9 ⇒ k ≡ 15 ⇒ m ≡ 264 (mod 289)\\n- The least positive m among these is 42.\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- If an odd prime p divides n^4 + 1, then n^8 ≡ 1 mod p while n^4 ≡ -1 ≠ 1 mod p, so the order of n modulo p is 8. Hence 8 | (p − 1), so p ≡ 1 mod 8. Also p = 2 cannot work since n^4 + 1 ≡ 1 or 2 mod 4, never 0 mod 4. Therefore the least such prime is p = 17.\\n- Modulo 17, x^4 ≡ −1 has four roots: x ≡ ±2, ±8 (since 2^4 = 16 ≡ −1 and 8^4 ≡ −1).\\n- Since f(x) = x^4 + 1 has f′(x) = 4x^3 not divisible by 17 at these roots, Hensel’s lemma gives a unique lift of each root to a root modulo 17^2 = 289.\\n- For each root r, write x = r + 17t and solve a + t f′(r) ≡ 0 mod 17, where r^4 + 1 = 17a.\\n  - r = 2: a = 1, f′(2) ≡ 15 ⇒ t ≡ −1·15^{-1} ≡ −1·8 ≡ 9 ⇒ x = 155.\\n  - r = 15: a = 1, f′(15) ≡ 2 ⇒ t ≡ −1·2^{-1} ≡ −1·9 ≡ 8 ⇒ x = 151.\\n  - r = 8: a ≡ 3, f′(8) ≡ 8 ⇒ t ≡ −3·8^{-1} ≡ −3·15 ≡ 6 ⇒ x = 110.\\n  - r = 9: a ≡ 12, f′(9) ≡ 9 ⇒ t ≡ −12·9^{-1} ≡ −12·2 ≡ 10 ⇒ x = 179.\\n- The four solutions modulo 289 are 110, 151, 155, 179; the least positive is 110. Direct check: 110^2 ≡ 251 (mod 289), so 110^4 ≡ 251^2 ≡ 288 (mod 289), hence 110^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289).\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1.

For an odd prime p to divide n^4 + 1, we require -1 to be a fourth power modulo p, which happens iff p ≡ 1 (mod 8). For lifting a root modulo p to a root modulo p^2, use Hensel’s lemma: if f(x) = x^4 + 1, and f(x0) ≡ 0 (mod p) with f′(x0) = 4x0^3 not ≡ 0 (mod p), then there is a unique lift x ≡ x0 (mod p) solving f(x) ≡ 0 (mod p^2). The smallest such prime is p = 17. We then find all roots x0 modulo 17 of x^4 ≡ -1 and lift each to modulo 289 to determine the smallest positive representative m with 289 | m^4 + 1.\\n\\n### Key Information Summary:\\n- p must be ≡ 1 (mod 8); the smallest such prime is p = 17.\\n- Solve x^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17): the roots are x ≡ ±2, ±8 (i.e., 2, 15, 8, 9).\\n- Lift each root x0 via m = x0 + 17k using f(x0 + 17k) ≡ 17(1 + 4x0^3 k) (mod 289) and solve 1 + 4x0^3 k ≡ 0 (mod 17):\\n  - x0 = 2: 4x0^3 ≡ 32 ≡ 15 ⇒ k ≡ 9 ⇒ m ≡ 155 (mod 289)\\n  - x0 = 15: 4x0^3 ≡ 2 ⇒ k ≡ 8 ⇒ m ≡ 151 (mod 289)\\n  - x0 = 8: 4x0^3 ≡ 8 ⇒ k ≡ 2 ⇒ m ≡ 42 (mod 289)\\n  - x0 = 9: 4x0^3 ≡ 9 ⇒ k ≡ 15 ⇒ m ≡ 264 (mod 289)\\n- The least positive m among these is 42.\\nC0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:\\n- If an odd prime p divides n^4 + 1, then n^8 ≡ 1 mod p while n^4 ≡ -1 ≠ 1 mod p, so the order of n modulo p is 8. Hence 8 | (p − 1), so p ≡ 1 mod 8. Also p = 2 cannot work since n^4 + 1 ≡ 1 or 2 mod 4, never 0 mod 4. Therefore the least such prime is p = 17.\\n- Modulo 17, x^4 ≡ −1 has four roots: x ≡ ±2, ±8 (since 2^4 = 16 ≡ −1 and 8^4 ≡ −1).\\n- Since f(x) = x^4 + 1 has f′(x) = 4x^3 not divisible by 17 at these roots, Hensel’s lemma gives a unique lift of each root to a root modulo 17^2 = 289.\\n- For each root r, write x = r + 17t and solve a + t f′(r) ≡ 0 mod 17, where r^4 + 1 = 17a.\\n  - r = 2: a = 1, f′(2) ≡ 15 ⇒ t ≡ −1·15^{-1} ≡ −1·8 ≡ 9 ⇒ x = 155.\\n  - r = 15: a = 1, f′(15) ≡ 2 ⇒ t ≡ −1·2^{-1} ≡ −1·9 ≡ 8 ⇒ x = 151.\\n  - r = 8: a ≡ 3, f′(8) ≡ 8 ⇒ t ≡ −3·8^{-1} ≡ −3·15 ≡ 6 ⇒ x = 110.\\n  - r = 9: a ≡ 12, f′(9) ≡ 9 ⇒ t ≡ −12·9^{-1} ≡ −12·2 ≡ 10 ⇒ x = 179.\\n- The four solutions modulo 289 are 110, 151, 155, 179; the least positive is 110. Direct check: 110^2 ≡ 251 (mod 289), so 110^4 ≡ 251^2 ≡ 288 (mod 289), hence 110^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289).\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Show any prime p with p | n^4 + 1 satisfies p ≡ 1 (mod 8); exclude p = 2.\\n2. Conclude the least possible p is 17.\\n3. Solve x^4 ≡ −1 (mod 17): roots are ±2, ±8; verify f′(x) ≠ 0 mod 17.\\n4. Apply Hensel’s lemma to lift each root to mod 17^2; compute lifts: 110, 151, 155, 179.\\n5. Conclude the least positive m with 17^2 | m^4 + 1 is 110.\\n\\n110\\nC0004 say to C0001: ### Calculations:\\n- For odd prime p | (n^4 + 1), n^8 ≡ 1 (mod p) and n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) ⇒ ord_p(n) = 8 ⇒ 8 | (p − 1) ⇒ p ≡ 1 (mod 8). Smallest such prime is p = 17. Also p = 2 fails since 4 ∤ (n^4 + 1).\\n- Solve x^4 ≡ −1 (mod 17):\\n  - 2^4 = 16 ≡ −1 (mod 17), so roots mod 17 are x ≡ ±2, ±8, i.e., {2, 15, 8, 9}.\\n- Hensel lift to mod 17^2 = 289. Let f(x) = x^4 + 1, f'(x) = 4x^3. For a root x0 mod 17, write f(x0) = 17a, then k ≡ −a · (f'(x0))^{-1} (mod 17) and the lift is r = x0 + 17k:\\n  - x0 = 2: f(2) = 17 ⇒ a = 1; f'(2) = 32 ≡ 15; inv(15) ≡ 8; k ≡ −1·8 ≡ 9; r = 2 + 9·17 = 155.\\n  - x0 = 15: symmetric ⇒ r = 289 − 155 = 134.\\n  - x0 = 8: f(8) = 4097 = 17·241 ⇒ a ≡ 241 ≡ 3; f'(8) = 2048 ≡ 8; inv(8) ≡ 15; k ≡ −3·15 ≡ −45 ≡ 6; r = 8 + 6·17 = 110.\\n  - x0 = 9: f(9) = 6562 = 17·386 ⇒ a ≡ 386 ≡ 12; f'(9) = 2916 ≡ 9; inv(9) ≡ 2; k ≡ −12·2 ≡ −24 ≡ 10; r = 9 + 10·17 = 179.\\n- Solutions mod 289 are {110, 134, 155, 179}. The least positive is 110.\\n- Quick check: 110^2 = 12100 ≡ 251 (mod 289); 251^2 = 1444 ≡ −1 (mod 289) ⇒ 110^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289).\\n\\n### Numerical Results:\\n- Least prime p: 17\\n- Least positive m with p^2 | m^4 + 1: 110\\n\\nIn this chat turn, you can take up to 3 actions, currently on action 1.

Also p = 2 fails since 4 ∤ (n^4 + 1).\\n- Solve x^4 ≡ −1 (mod 17):\\n  - 2^4 = 16 ≡ −1 (mod 17), so roots mod 17 are x ≡ ±2, ±8, i.e., {2, 15, 8, 9}.\\n- Hensel lift to mod 17^2 = 289. Let f(x) = x^4 + 1, f'(x) = 4x^3. For a root x0 mod 17, write f(x0) = 17a, then k ≡ −a · (f'(x0))^{-1} (mod 17) and the lift is r = x0 + 17k:\\n  - x0 = 2: f(2) = 17 ⇒ a = 1; f'(2) = 32 ≡ 15; inv(15) ≡ 8; k ≡ −1·8 ≡ 9; r = 2 + 9·17 = 155.\\n  - x0 = 15: symmetric ⇒ r = 289 − 155 = 134.\\n  - x0 = 8: f(8) = 4097 = 17·241 ⇒ a ≡ 241 ≡ 3; f'(8) = 2048 ≡ 8; inv(8) ≡ 15; k ≡ −3·15 ≡ −45 ≡ 6; r = 8 + 6·17 = 110.\\n  - x0 = 9: f(9) = 6562 = 17·386 ⇒ a ≡ 386 ≡ 12; f'(9) = 2916 ≡ 9; inv(9) ≡ 2; k ≡ −12·2 ≡ −24 ≡ 10; r = 9 + 10·17 = 179.\\n- Solutions mod 289 are {110, 134, 155, 179}. The least positive is 110.\\n- Quick check: 110^2 = 12100 ≡ 251 (mod 289); 251^2 = 1444 ≡ −1 (mod 289) ⇒ 110^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289).\\n\\n### Numerical Results:\\n- Least prime p: 17\\n- Least positive m with p^2 | m^4 + 1: 110\\nC0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: \\n- The least prime p with p^2 | n^4 + 1 must satisfy that −1 is a fourth power mod p, which requires p ≡ 1 (mod 8). The smallest such prime is p = 17. This is correct.\\n- The solution set modulo 17 for x^4 ≡ −1 is {±2, ±8}. Correct.\\n- In Hensel lifting, for f(x) = x^4 + 1, the lift x = r + 17t requires t ≡ −k · (f′(r))^−1 (mod 17), where k ≡ (r^4 + 1)/17 (mod 17). An error occurs if one assumes k ≡ 1 for all roots r; this holds for r = ±2 but not for r = ±8 (where k ≡ 3 mod 17).\\n- Previously reported lifted values like 134 and 179 are incorrect; the correct lifts from r = −2 and r = −8 are 151 and 196 respectively.\\n\\n### Corrections: \\n- Use Hensel’s lifting:\\n  - r = 2: k = 1, f′(2) = 15, (15)^−1 ≡ 8 ⇒ t ≡ −8 ≡ 9 ⇒ x = 2 + 17·9 = 155.\\n  - r = −2: k = 1, f′(−2) = 2, (2)^−1 ≡ 9 ⇒ t ≡ −9 ≡ 8 ⇒ x = 15 + 17·8 = 151.\\n  - r = 8: k ≡ 241 ≡ 3, f′(8) ≡ 8, (8)^−1 ≡ 15 ⇒ t ≡ −3·15 ≡ 6 ⇒ x = 8 + 17·6 = 110.\\n  - r = −8: k ≡ 3, f′(−8) ≡ 9, (9)^−1 ≡ 2 ⇒ t ≡ −3·2 ≡ 11 ⇒ x = 9 + 17·11 = 196.\\n- The four solutions modulo 289 are 110, 151, 155, 196.

The smallest such prime is p = 17.\\n- Solve x^4 ≡ −1 (mod 17): roots are x ≡ ±2, ±8.\\n- Hensel lifting for f(x) = x^4 + 1 to mod 17^2 = 289:\\n  - For r = 2: a = (r^4 + 1)/17 = 1, f′(r) ≡ 15 ⇒ t ≡ −1·15^{-1} ≡ 9 ⇒ x = 155.\\n  - For r = −2 ≡ 15: a ≡ 3 (mod 17), f′(r) ≡ 2 ⇒ t ≡ −3·2^{-1} ≡ 7 ⇒ x = 134.\\n  - For r = 8: a ≡ 3, f′(r) ≡ 8 ⇒ t ≡ −3·8^{-1} ≡ 6 ⇒ x = 110.\\n  - For r = 9 ≡ −8: a ≡ 12, f′(r) ≡ 9 ⇒ t ≡ −12·9^{-1} ≡ 10 ⇒ x = 179.\\n- Thus the solutions modulo 289 are {110, 134, 155, 179}; the least positive is 110.\\n- Corrections noted: Claims of m = 42 and lifts 151 or 196 were due to taking a = 1 incorrectly for all roots; correct minimal m is 110.\\nC0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: We seek the least prime p such that there exists n with p^2 | n^4 + 1. This requires a solution to x^4 ≡ -1 mod p, which occurs iff p ≡ 1 mod 8. The smallest such prime is p = 17. By Hensel lifting, any solution mod 17 lifts uniquely to mod 17^2 since f'(x) = 4x^3 ≠ 0 mod 17 at solutions.\\n\\nSolutions to x^4 ≡ -1 mod 17 are x ≡ ±2, ±8. Lifting each via j = -(f(x0)/p)·(f'(x0))^{-1} mod 17 and x1 = x0 + 17·j yields:\\n- x0 = 2 → x = 155\\n- x0 = 15 → x = 151\\n- x0 = 8 → x = 110\\n- x0 = 9 → x = 179\\n\\nThus the least positive m with 17^2 | m^4 + 1 is m = 110.
