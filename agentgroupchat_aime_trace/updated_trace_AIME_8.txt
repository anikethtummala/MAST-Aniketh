C0003 say to All: ### Context Analysis: 
We are given real numbers x and y with x > 1 and y > 1. Two logarithmic equations are provided: log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^(4y) equals 10. These define a system that relates x and y, and the task is to determine the product xy, which is stated to be an integer.

### Key Information Summary:
- Variables and constraints: x > 1, y > 1 (real numbers).
- Given equations:
  1) log_x(y^x) = 10
  2) log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
- Equivalent exponential forms:
  1) y^x = x^{10}
  2) x^{4y} = y^{10}
- Equivalent logarithmic relations:
  1) log_x y = 10/x
  2) log_y x = 5/(2y)
- Objective: Solve the system under the constraints and compute xy (an integer).

C0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:
- From log_x(y^x) = 10, we have y^x = x^{10}. Taking natural logs gives x ln y = 10 ln x, hence ln y = (10 ln x)/x.
- From log_y(x^{4y}) = 10, we have x^{4y} = y^{10}. Taking natural logs gives 4y ln x = 10 ln y, hence ln y = (2y/5) ln x.
- Equate the two expressions for ln y: (10 ln x)/x = (2y/5) ln x. Since x > 1, ln x > 0, so we can cancel ln x and obtain 10/x = 2y/5, which simplifies to xy = 25.
- Existence check: Define g(x) = x ln 25 − (x + 10) ln x on (1, 25). We have g(1) = ln 25 > 0 and g(5) = −5 ln 5 < 0, so by continuity there exists x ∈ (1, 5) with g(x) = 0. Then y = 25/x > 1 satisfies both equations. Hence the solution exists with x, y > 1.

### Proof Structure:
1. Convert both logarithmic equations to exponential/logarithmic form.
2. Derive two expressions for ln y and equate them.
3. Use x > 1 to justify cancellation of ln x and deduce xy = 25.
4. Verify existence of a solution with x, y > 1 via intermediate value theorem.
5. Conclude xy = 25.

C0004 say to All: ### Calculations:
Given:
log_x(y^x) = 10 => x ln y = 10 ln x
log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 => 4y ln x = 10 ln y

Multiply the two equations:
(x ln y)(4y ln x) = (10 ln x)(10 ln y)
4xy (ln x)(ln y) = 100 (ln x)(ln y)

Since x, y > 1, ln x > 0 and ln y > 0, so we can cancel (ln x)(ln y):
4xy = 100
xy = 25

C0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: No prior solution provided to assess. Solving the system: from log_x(y^x)=10 ⇒ x ln y = 10 ln x and log_y(x^{4y})=10 ⇒ 4y ln x = 10 ln y. Let a=ln x>0, b=ln y>0. Then b e^a=10a and 4a e^b=10b. Multiplying the ratios gives e^{a+b}=25 ⇒ ln(xy)=ln 25 ⇒ xy=25. Existence check: using b=10a/e^a and a+b=ln 25 has a positive solution (e.g., a≈0.428, b≈2.79), so x,y>1 hold.

C0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: 
From log_x(y^x)=10 and log_y(x^{4y})=10, using change of base:
- x ln y / ln x = 10
- 4y ln x / ln y = 10

Thus ln y / ln x = 10/x and also ln y / ln x = 2y/5. Equate to get 10/x = 2y/5, hence xy = 25. Since x>1 and y>1, ln x and ln y are positive, so divisions are valid. Existence is consistent (e.g., with y=25/x, one can solve (x+10)ln x = x ln 25 for some x in (1,2) ensuring solutions exist). Therefore, the product xy is uniquely determined as 25.
