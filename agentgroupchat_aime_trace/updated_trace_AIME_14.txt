C0003 say to All: ### Context Analysis:
We are counting lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) in an 8×8 grid using 16 unit steps (8 rights R and 8 ups U). A “direction change” occurs when the step type switches between R and U. Exactly four direction changes imply the path consists of five maximal straight segments (runs) that strictly alternate between R and U.

### Key Information Summary:
- Total steps: 16 = 8 R + 8 U.
- Exactly 4 direction changes ⇒ 5 alternating runs.
- Two possible alternating patterns: R-U-R-U-R or U-R-U-R-U.
- In pattern R-U-R-U-R: R appears in 3 runs, U in 2 runs; run lengths are positive integers.
  - Count = compositions of 8 into 3 positive parts for R: C(7,2), and into 2 positive parts for U: C(7,1).
- In pattern U-R-U-R-U: roles swap; same counts apply.
- Total model: 2 × C(7,2) × C(7,1).

C0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:
A path from (0,0) to (8,8) consists of 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U). Exactly 4 direction changes means the sequence has 5 alternating runs. There are two starting patterns: R-U-R-U-R and U-R-U-R-U. In the R-start case, R occurs in 3 positive-length runs summing to 8, and U in 2 positive-length runs summing to 8. The counts of compositions are C(7,2) for the 3 R-runs and C(7,1) for the 2 U-runs. The U-start case is symmetric. Total paths: 2 * C(7,2) * C(7,1) = 2 * 21 * 7 = 294.

### Proof Structure:
1. Model paths as sequences of R and U of total length 16 with 8 R and 8 U.
2. Exactly 4 direction changes implies 5 alternating runs; starting direction can be R or U.
3. Count compositions of 8 into positive parts: for R-start, R has 3 runs → C(7,2)=21; U has 2 runs → C(7,1)=7.
4. Symmetry doubles the count: total = 2 * 21 * 7 = 294.

C0004 say to All: ### Calculations: 
- A path from (0,0) to (8,8) has 8 R and 8 U moves (total length 16). Exactly 4 direction changes means 5 alternating runs of R/U, each run length ≥ 1.
- Case 1: Start with R (pattern R-U-R-U-R). R is split into 3 positive parts summing to 8: C(7,2)=21. U is split into 2 positive parts summing to 8: C(7,1)=7. Count = 21*7 = 147.
- Case 2: Start with U (pattern U-R-U-R-U). Symmetric, also 147.
- Total = 147 + 147 = 294.

C0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: The solution models paths as sequences of R and U with exactly 4 direction changes, implying 5 alternating runs. This is correct. Counting positive compositions for run lengths is appropriate: starting with R gives compositions of 8 into 3 R-runs (C(7,2)=21) and 8 into 2 U-runs (C(7,1)=7), product 147; starting with U is symmetric, also 147. No double counting or boundary issues. No errors found.

C0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: To reach (8,8) using only R and U with exactly 4 direction changes, the path has 5 alternating runs. Two start patterns: R-U-R-U-R (3 R-runs, 2 U-runs) or U-R-U-R-U (3 U-runs, 2 R-runs). Each run length is a positive integer, with R-run lengths summing to 8 and U-run lengths summing to 8. The number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts is C(7,2)=21; into 2 parts is C(7,1)=7. For each start pattern: 21*7=147. Total = 2*147 = 294. No coupling between R and U compositions beyond positivity, so multiplication is valid.
