Taking natural logs gives x ln y = 10 ln x, hence ln y = (10 ln x)/x.\\n- From log_y(x^{4y}) = 10, we have x^{4y} = y^{10}. Taking natural logs gives 4y ln x = 10 ln y, hence ln y = (2y/5) ln x.\\n- Equate the two expressions for ln y: (10 ln x)/x = (2y/5) ln x. Since x > 1, ln x > 0, so we can cancel ln x and obtain 10/x = 2y/5, which simplifies to xy = 25.\\n- Existence check: Define g(x) = x ln 25 − (x + 10) ln x on (1, 25). We have g(1) = ln 25 > 0 and g(5) = −5 ln 5 < 0, so by continuity there exists x ∈ (1, 5) with g(x) = 0. Then y = 25/x > 1 satisfies both equations. Hence the solution exists with x, y > 1.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Convert both logarithmic equations to exponential/logarithmic form.\\n2. Derive two expressions for ln y and equate them.\\n3.

Taking natural logs gives x ln y = 10 ln x, hence ln y = (10 ln x)/x.\\n- From log_y(x^{4y}) = 10, we have x^{4y} = y^{10}. Taking natural logs gives 4y ln x = 10 ln y, hence ln y = (2y/5) ln x.\\n- Equate the two expressions for ln y: (10 ln x)/x = (2y/5) ln x. Since x > 1, ln x > 0, so we can cancel ln x and obtain 10/x = 2y/5, which simplifies to xy = 25.\\n- Existence check: Define g(x) = x ln 25 − (x + 10) ln x on (1, 25). We have g(1) = ln 25 > 0 and g(5) = −5 ln 5 < 0, so by continuity there exists x ∈ (1, 5) with g(x) = 0. Then y = 25/x > 1 satisfies both equations. Hence the solution exists with x, y > 1.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Convert both logarithmic equations to exponential/logarithmic form.\\n2. Derive two expressions for ln y and equate them.\\n3. Use x > 1 to justify cancellation of ln x and deduce xy = 25.\\n4. Verify existence of a solution with x, y > 1 via intermediate value theorem.\\n5. Conclude xy = 25.\\nC0004 say to All: ### Calculations:\\nGiven:\\nlog_x(y^x) = 10 => x ln y = 10 ln x\\nlog_y(x^{4y}) = 10 => 4y ln x = 10 ln y\\n\\nMultiply the two equations:\\n(x ln y)(4y ln x) = (10 ln x)(10 ln y)\\n4xy (ln x)(ln y) = 100 (ln x)(ln y)\\n\\nSince x, y > 1, ln x > 0 and ln y > 0, so we can cancel (ln x)(ln y):\\n4xy = 100\\nxy = 25\\n\\n### Numerical Results:\\n25\\nC0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: No prior solution provided to assess. Solving the system: from log_x(y^x)=10 ⇒ x ln y = 10 ln x and log_y(x^{4y})=10 ⇒ 4y ln x = 10 ln y. Let a=ln x>0, b=ln y>0. Then b e^a=10a and 4a e^b=10b. Multiplying the ratios gives e^{a+b}=25 ⇒ ln(xy)=ln 25 ⇒ xy=25.
