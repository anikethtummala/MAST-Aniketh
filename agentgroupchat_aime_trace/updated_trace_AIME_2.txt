C0003 say to All: ### Context Analysis:
Jen selects 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1, 2, ..., 10}. Independently, 4 numbers are drawn uniformly at random from S. Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her chosen numbers are among the drawn numbers, and she wins the grand prize if all 4 of her chosen numbers match the drawn numbers. We are to find the conditional probability of winning the grand prize given that she has won a prize, and ultimately express it as m/n and compute m + n.

### Key Information Summary:
- Model as a hypergeometric setup with:
  - Population size: 10
  - Success states (Jen’s numbers): 4
  - Draws: 4
- Let K be the number of matches between Jen’s numbers and the drawn numbers.
  - P(K = k) = C(4, k) * C(6, 4 − k) / C(10, 4), for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Prize event B: K ≥ 2 (i.e., k = 2, 3, or 4).
- Grand prize event A: K = 4.
- Desired conditional probability:
  P(A | B) = P(K = 4) / P(K ≥ 2)
           = [C(4, 4) * C(6, 0)] / [C(4, 2) * C(6, 2) + C(4, 3) * C(6, 1) + C(4, 4) * C(6, 0)].

C0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:
- Jen chooses 4 distinct numbers from S = {1, 2, ..., 10}. Independently, 4 numbers are drawn uniformly at random from S without replacement.
- Let K be the number of matches between Jen’s chosen set and the drawn set. Then K follows a hypergeometric distribution with parameters (population size 10, number of “successes” 4, draw size 4):
  P(K = k) = C(4, k) C(6, 4 − k) / C(10, 4), for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Define events:
  - A: “Grand prize” = {K = 4}.
  - B: “Wins a prize” = {K ≥ 2}.
- The desired probability is the conditional probability P(A | B) = P(K = 4) / P(K ≥ 2).

### Proof Structure:
1. Model matching count K as hypergeometric: P(K = k) = C(4, k) C(6, 4 − k) / C(10, 4).
2. Identify events:
   - A = {K = 4}.
   - B = {K ∈ {2, 3, 4}}.
3. Write conditional probability:
   P(A | B) = P(K = 4) / [P(K = 2) + P(K = 3) + P(K = 4)].
4. Substitute hypergeometric terms and cancel the common denominator C(10, 4):
   P(A | B) = [C(4, 4) C(6, 0)] / [C(4, 2) C(6, 2) + C(4, 3) C(6, 1) + C(4, 4) C(6, 0)].

C0004 say to All: ### Calculations:
- Let X be the number of matches between Jen’s 4 numbers and the 4 randomly chosen numbers from S (|S|=10).
- P(X=k) = C(4,k) C(6,4-k) / C(10,4), for k=0,1,2,3,4; with C(10,4)=210.
- Compute:
  - k=2: C(4,2)C(6,2) = 6*15 = 90 → 90/210
  - k=3: C(4,3)C(6,1) = 4*6 = 24 → 24/210
  - k=4: C(4,4)C(6,0) = 1*1 = 1 → 1/210
- Prize event: X ≥ 2 ⇒ P(prize) = (90+24+1)/210 = 115/210 = 23/42.
- Grand prize: X=4 ⇒ P(grand) = 1/210.
- Conditional probability: P(grand | prize) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.
- Thus m=1, n=115 ⇒ m+n=116.

C0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:
- Fix Jen’s chosen set A of 4 numbers from S. The lottery draws a random 4-subset B from S uniformly among C(10,4) = 210 possibilities.
- We want P(B = A | |A ∩ B| ≥ 2) = P(B = A) / P(|A ∩ B| ≥ 2), since B = A implies intersection size 4.
- P(B = A) = 1/210.
- Count the number of B with exactly k matches with A: C(4, k) · C(6, 4 − k).
  - For k ≥ 2: 
    - k = 2: C(4,2)·C(6,2) = 6·15 = 90
    - k = 3: C(4,3)·C(6,1) = 4·6 = 24
    - k = 4: C(4,4)·C(6,0) = 1·1 = 1
  - Total favorable for “at least 2 matches” = 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.
- Therefore, P(|A ∩ B| ≥ 2) = 115/210.

Hence the conditional probability is (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115, so m/n = 1/115, and m + n = 116.

### Proof Structure:
1. Model the draw as selecting a random 4-subset B from S; fix Jen’s 4-subset A.
2. Use conditional probability formula: P(B = A | |A ∩ B| ≥ 2) = P(B = A)/P(|A ∩ B| ≥ 2).
3. Compute numerator: P(B = A) = 1/C(10,4) = 1/210.
4. Compute denominator by counting intersections:
   - Exactly k common elements count: C(4,k)·C(6,4−k).
   - Sum for k = 2,3,4 gives 115 subsets, so probability = 115/210.
5. Divide to get 1/115; thus m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

C0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: 
Let K be the number of matches between Jen’s fixed 4-number set and the random 4-number draw from {1,...,10}. Then K ~ Hypergeometric(N=10, K=4, n=4), so:
- P(K=4) = C(4,4)C(6,0)/C(10,4) = 1/210
- P(K=3) = C(4,3)C(6,1)/C(10,4) = 24/210
- P(K=2) = C(4,2)C(6,2)/C(10,4) = 90/210

Prize event: K ≥ 2, so P(prize) = (1 + 24 + 90)/210 = 115/210.
Grand prize event: K = 4, so P(grand | prize) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.
Thus m+n = 1+115 = 116.

### Correctness Confirmation: 
The counting uses standard hypergeometric probabilities with correct parameters. The conditional probability is computed correctly, and the final result m+n = 116 is verified.
