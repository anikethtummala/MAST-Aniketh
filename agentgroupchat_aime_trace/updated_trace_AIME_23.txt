C0003 say to All: ### Context Analysis: We are given a list of positive integers with total sum 30, unique mode 9, and an integer median that does not appear in the list. An integer median not in the list implies the list has even length and the two middle numbers average to an integer not present.

### Key Information Summary: 
- Unique mode 9 requires 9 to appear more frequently than any other number; minimal viable count is two 9s. More (e.g., three 9s) would force the median to be 9, which is invalid.
- Let the list have 4 elements: two 9s and two other positive integers summing to 12.
- To avoid median 9, both non-9s must be less than 9, and the upper middle with 9 must average to an integer. Hence the larger non-9 must be odd.
- The only pair of positive integers <9 summing to 12 with the larger odd is 5 and 7.
- Valid list: [5, 7, 9, 9]; median = (7+9)/2 = 8 (not in list); unique mode = 9; sum = 30.
- Sum of squares: 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236.

C0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:
- The median is an integer not in the list, so the list length n must be even (for odd n, the median is an element of the list).
- Let k be the count of 9s. Since 9 is the unique mode, k ≥ 2. Also 4·9 > 30, so k ≤ 3.
- If k = 3, the remaining sum is 30 − 27 = 3, forcing at least three 1s, tying the mode with 9 → contradiction. Hence k = 2.
- The remaining numbers sum to 12 and must all be distinct and not equal to 9 (to keep 9 the unique mode).
- Check possible even lengths:
  - n = 4: two other numbers a < b with a + b = 12. If b ≥ 10, the sorted list is [a, 9, 9, b] and the median is 9 (forbidden). If b = 9, not allowed. Thus b ≤ 8. The pairs are (4,8) and (5,7). The median is (b + 9)/2; it must be an integer not in the list, so b must be odd → b = 7 and a = 5. Median = (7 + 9)/2 = 8, not in the list; mode 9 is unique; sum is 30. Valid.
  - n = 6: four distinct positives sum to 12 → only {1,2,3,6} or {1,2,4,5}. Sorted with two 9s, the middle pair averages are (3,6) → 4.5 and (4,5) → 4.5, not integers. Invalid.
  - n ≥ 8: minimal sum of six distinct positives is 21 > 12. Impossible.
- Therefore the unique valid list is [5,7,9,9]. Sum of squares: 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236.

### Proof Structure:
1. Median not in list implies even length.
2. Count of 9s k satisfies 2 ≤ k ≤ 3; k = 3 contradicts unique mode due to sum constraints → k = 2.
3. With k = 2, remaining sum 12 must be partitioned into distinct positives.
4. n = 4: only (5,7) yields integer median 8 not in the list; satisfies all conditions.
5. n = 6 yields non-integer median; n ≥ 8 impossible by minimal sum.
6. Conclude list [5,7,9,9] and compute sum of squares = 236.

C0004 say to All: ### Calculations:
- Let the number of 9s be k. Since 9 is the unique mode and sum is 30, k ≥ 2. k=3 makes the median 9 (appears in the list), invalid. k≥4 exceeds the sum. So k=2.
- Let there be m other numbers (distinct to keep 9 as unique mode). Then m = n − 2 must be even (median must be an integer not in the list, so n is even).
- The remaining sum is 12 spread over m distinct positive integers, all ≤ 8 (any ≥ 10 would force the median to be 9).
- If m=4: need 4 distinct positives ≤8 summing to 12. The only sets are {1,2,3,6} and {1,2,4,5}, both give median (a3+a4)/2 = 4.5, not integer. So m≠4.
- Hence m=2: Let the two numbers be a1 < a2 < 9 with a1 + a2 = 12. The pairs are (4,8), (5,7). For integer median with list [a1, a2, 9, 9], we need (a2 + 9)/2 integer ⇒ a2 odd ⇒ a2=7. Thus the list is [5,7,9,9].
- Sum of squares: 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236.

C0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: 
- The conclusion that the list must have even length is correct, since the median must be an integer not present in the list; an odd-length list would have a median equal to a list element.
- For k=3 occurrences of 9, the summary’s conclusion is correct (no solution): 
  - With t=1 and remaining sum 3, list [3,9,9,9] has median 9 (invalid).
  - With t=3 and remaining sum 3, list [1,1,1,9,9,9] ties the mode (invalid).
  - However, the earlier notion that this “forces three 1s” is not strictly necessary; t=1 is also possible but fails by median.
- For k=2, remaining sum 12, the summary correctly narrows to t even. For t=2 (n=4), it only mentioned pairs (5,7) and (4,8), omitting (1,11) and (2,10). These omissions do not affect the final result, but should be explicitly excluded since they yield median 9 (present in the list).
- For t=4 (n=6), the only distinct partitions of 12 are {1,2,3,6} and {1,2,4,5}, both yielding non-integer medians; this was correctly concluded.
- Final list [5,7,9,9] and sum of squares calculation appear correct.

### Corrections: 
- Clarify k=3 case: Show both t=1 -> median 9 (invalid) and t=3 -> mode tie (invalid), rather than implying it “forces three 1s.”
- Explicitly rule out t=2 pairs (1,11) and (2,10) because they produce median 9, which is in the list.
- The valid list is [5,7,9,9], yielding sum of squares 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236.

C0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: 
- Let t be the count of 9s. If t ≥ 3, either the median is 9 (e.g., [a,9,9,9]) or another value ties the mode (e.g., [1,1,1,9,9,9]), so t=3 fails, and t≥4 is impossible by sum constraints.
- Thus t=2. The remaining sum is 12 split among m other numbers, all distinct (to keep 9 as unique mode) and n even ⇒ m even.
- m=2: distinct pairs summing to 12 are (1,11), (2,10), (4,8), (5,7). Only [5,7,9,9] yields an integer median 8 not in the list. Others give median 9 or non-integer.
- m=4: only [1,2,3,6] and [1,2,4,5]; both give non-integer medians. Larger m impossible.
- Hence the unique valid list is [5,7,9,9]. Sum of squares = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236.

### Correctness Confirmation: All constraints are satisfied uniquely by [5,7,9,9]; the required integer answer is 236.
----END MESSAGE----

C0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: 
Sum constraint and unique mode imply at least two 9s. If there are three 9s, the remaining sum is 3, which fails the median condition or creates a tie for mode, so f=3 is impossible. With exactly two 9s, the remaining distinct positive integers must sum to 12. Possible distinct partitions are: (11,1), (10,2), (8,4), (7,5), and (5,4,2,1). Checking medians for the full lists:
- [1,9,9,11] and [2,9,9,10] have median 9 (appears) → invalid.
- [4,8,9,9] has non-integer median 8.5 → invalid.
- [1,2,4,5,9,9] has non-integer median 4.5 → invalid.
- [5,7,9,9] has median 8, an integer not in the list, and 9 is the unique mode.

Thus the valid list is [5,7,9,9]. Sum of squares = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236.

### Correctness Confirmation: 
All constraints are satisfied and the solution is unique under the given conditions. Final answer: 236.
----END MESSAGE----

C0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: Verified constraints systematically. The list length must be even for the median to be an integer not in the list. Checked counts of 9:
- k=3 leads to median 9 or tie in mode; invalid.
- k=2 requires all other numbers distinct. For m=2 (two other numbers summing to 12), only pair (5,7) works; pairs with b≥9 give median 9 (invalid), and (4,8) gives non-integer median.
- For m=4 (four distinct others summing to 12), possible sets [1,2,3,6] and [1,2,4,5] yield non-integer medians.
Thus the unique valid list is [5,7,9,9]. Sum of squares = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236. No errors found.

### Corrections: None. Final answer: 236

C0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:
- Let the frequency of 9 be t. If t ≥ 3, the remaining sum is ≤ 3, forcing n to be 4 or 5. For t = 3:
  - With others {3}: list [3,9,9,9] has median 9 (appears), invalid.
  - With others {1,2}: n is odd, median must appear, invalid.
  Hence t ≠ 3. So t = 2 is necessary (t = 1 cannot give 9 as unique mode).
- With two 9s, the remaining sum is 12. The list length n must be even (median not in list), so the number of other terms k is even.
  - If k = 4, the only partitions of 12 into 4 distinct positives are {1,2,3,6} and {1,2,4,5}. In a 6-term list [others, 9, 9], the median is the average of the two largest others: (3,6) → 4.5 and (4,5) → 4.5, not integer. So k ≠ 4.
  - Thus k = 2. Let the other numbers be x ≤ y with x + y = 12. If y > 9, the sorted list is [x,9,9,y] and the median is 9 (appears), invalid. So y ≤ 8. For the median (y+9)/2 to be integer, y must be odd, giving y ∈ {1,3,5,7}. Feasible pairs (x,y) with x + y = 12 and y ≤ 8 are only (5,7). Hence the unique valid list is [5,7,9,9].
- This list satisfies:
  - Sum = 5 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 30.
  - Unique mode = 9 (appears twice; others once).
  - Median = (7 + 9)/2 = 8, an integer not in the list.

Sum of squares: 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236.

### Proof Structure:
1. Show t ≥ 3 leads to impossible or invalid medians; conclude t = 2.
2. Enforce even n; analyze k = 4 (impossible integer median) and conclude k = 2.
3. Solve x + y = 12 with ordering constraints to avoid median equaling a listed value; deduce (x,y) = (5,7).
4. Verify all conditions and compute sum of squares = 236.

C0004 say to All: ### Calculations: 
- Let the list be of even length so the median can be an integer not in the list (as the average of two middle terms).
- The unique mode is 9, so 9 must appear at least twice. Three 9s are impossible due to the median condition and sum constraints.
- Use two 9s: remaining sum = 30 - 18 = 12, with all other numbers distinct (to keep 9 as unique mode).
- With k=2 other numbers (to keep even length), find distinct a,b ≠ 9 with a+b=12. The candidates are (5,7) and (4,8); only (5,7) yields an integer median not in the list:
  - List: [5,7,9,9] → median = (7+9)/2 = 8, which is not in the list.
- Sum of squares: 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236.
