C0003 say to All: ### Context Analysis:
We have a normal-play subtraction game with move set {1, 4}. Define P-positions (previous player wins; next to move loses) and N-positions (next player wins). Base: 0 is P. A position is N if it has a move to a P-position; otherwise it is P. Evaluating small n yields a repeating pattern with period 5:
- P-positions: n = 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, ... → n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 5)
- N-positions: n ≡ 1, 3, 4 (mod 5)

Since Alice goes first, Bob (second player) wins exactly when the starting n is a P-position.

### Key Information Summary:
- Moves allowed: remove 1 or 4 tokens.
- P/N rule: 0 is P; N if can move to P; P if all moves go to N.
- Derived pattern: P-positions are precisely n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 5).
- Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy iff the initial n is a P-position, i.e., n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 5).
- To answer the question, count positive integers n ≤ 2024 with n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 5).

C0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:
- Model the game as an impartial take-away game with moves {1, 4}. Classify positions as P (previous player wins; losing for the next player) or N (next player wins).
- Base: 0 is P. Recurrence: n is N iff at least one of n−1 or n−4 is P; otherwise n is P.
- Compute by residues modulo 5. Using induction:
  - If n ≡ 0 (mod 5): n−1 ≡ 4 and n−4 ≡ 1. Both are N, so n is P.
  - If n ≡ 1: n−1 ≡ 0 is P, so n is N.
  - If n ≡ 2: n−1 ≡ 1 (N) and n−4 ≡ 3 (N), so n is P.
  - If n ≡ 3: n−1 ≡ 2 is P, so n is N.
  - If n ≡ 4: n−4 ≡ 0 is P, so n is N.
- Therefore, P-positions are exactly n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 5). Since Alice moves first, Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy precisely when the initial n is a P-position.

### Proof Structure:
1. Define P/N positions with base case P(0).
2. Use the standard recurrence for subtraction games: N(n) iff P(n−1) or P(n−4); else P(n).
3. Perform inductive classification by residue mod 5, leveraging that 1 and 4 generate a period of 5.
4. Conclude: P-positions = {n: n ≡ 0, 2 (mod 5)}. Bob wins for exactly these n.

C0004 say to All: ### Calculations: 
- In the subtraction game with moves {1,4}, P-positions (second player wins) are n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 5).
- Count n ≤ 2024 with n ≡ 0 (mod 5): floor(2024/5) = 404.
- Count n ≤ 2024 with n ≡ 2 (mod 5): floor((2024 - 2)/5) + 1 = floor(2022/5) + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405.
- Total = 404 + 405 = 809.

C0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: The P-positions for the subtraction game with moves {1,4} are correctly identified as n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 5), confirmed by base cases (0,2,5,7,10,...). Counting for n ≤ 2024: there are floor(2024/5)=404 numbers ≡0 mod 5 and ((2022-2)/5)+1=405 numbers ≡2 mod 5. Total = 404+405=809. No logical or arithmetic errors detected.
### Corrections: None. Final answer: 809

C0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: 
- Game is a normal-play subtraction game with moves {1, 4}. Let P-positions be losing for the player to move, N-positions winning.
- Base and small cases: 
  n=0 (P), n=1 (N→0), n=2 (P→1), n=3 (N→2), n=4 (N→0), n=5 (P→1 or 4). 
- Pattern emerges: P-positions are exactly n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 5). This persists by the standard recurrence: a position is P iff all legal moves go to N; periodicity with period 5 holds for subtraction games.
- Bob wins iff the starting position is P (since Alice goes first). Thus count n ≤ 2024 with n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 5), n ≥ 1.
- Count: 
  - Multiples of 5 up to 2024: floor(2024/5) = 404.
  - Numbers ≡ 2 mod 5: 2, 7, ..., 2022 → ((2022−2)/5)+1 = 404+1 = 405.
  - Total = 404 + 405 = 809.
