C0003 say to All: ### Context Analysis:
We need the least prime p such that p^2 divides n^4 + 1 for some positive integer n, and then the least positive integer m such that p^2 divides m^4 + 1. For an odd prime p to divide n^4 + 1, we require -1 to be a fourth power modulo p, which happens iff p ≡ 1 (mod 8). For lifting a root modulo p to a root modulo p^2, use Hensel’s lemma: if f(x) = x^4 + 1, and f(x0) ≡ 0 (mod p) with f′(x0) = 4x0^3 not ≡ 0 (mod p), then there is a unique lift x ≡ x0 (mod p) solving f(x) ≡ 0 (mod p^2). The smallest such prime is p = 17. We then find all roots x0 modulo 17 of x^4 ≡ -1 and lift each to modulo 289 to determine the smallest positive representative m with 289 | m^4 + 1.

### Key Information Summary:
- p must be ≡ 1 (mod 8); the smallest such prime is p = 17.
- Solve x^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17): the roots are x ≡ ±2, ±8 (i.e., 2, 15, 8, 9).
- Lift each root x0 via m = x0 + 17k using f(x0 + 17k) ≡ 17(1 + 4x0^3 k) (mod 289) and solve 1 + 4x0^3 k ≡ 0 (mod 17):
  - x0 = 2: 4x0^3 ≡ 32 ≡ 15 ⇒ k ≡ 9 ⇒ m ≡ 155 (mod 289)
  - x0 = 15: 4x0^3 ≡ 2 ⇒ k ≡ 8 ⇒ m ≡ 151 (mod 289)
  - x0 = 8: 4x0^3 ≡ 8 ⇒ k ≡ 2 ⇒ m ≡ 42 (mod 289)
  - x0 = 9: 4x0^3 ≡ 9 ⇒ k ≡ 15 ⇒ m ≡ 264 (mod 289)
- The least positive m among these is 42.

C0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:
- If an odd prime p divides n^4 + 1, then n^8 ≡ 1 mod p while n^4 ≡ -1 ≠ 1 mod p, so the order of n modulo p is 8. Hence 8 | (p − 1), so p ≡ 1 mod 8. Also p = 2 cannot work since n^4 + 1 ≡ 1 or 2 mod 4, never 0 mod 4. Therefore the least such prime is p = 17.
- Modulo 17, x^4 ≡ −1 has four roots: x ≡ ±2, ±8 (since 2^4 = 16 ≡ −1 and 8^4 ≡ −1).
- Since f(x) = x^4 + 1 has f′(x) = 4x^3 not divisible by 17 at these roots, Hensel’s lemma gives a unique lift of each root to a root modulo 17^2 = 289.
- For each root r, write x = r + 17t and solve a + t f′(r) ≡ 0 mod 17, where r^4 + 1 = 17a.
  - r = 2: a = 1, f′(2) ≡ 15 ⇒ t ≡ −1·15^{-1} ≡ −1·8 ≡ 9 ⇒ x = 155.
  - r = 15: a = 1, f′(15) ≡ 2 ⇒ t ≡ −1·2^{-1} ≡ −1·9 ≡ 8 ⇒ x = 151.
  - r = 8: a ≡ 3, f′(8) ≡ 8 ⇒ t ≡ −3·8^{-1} ≡ −3·15 ≡ 6 ⇒ x = 110.
  - r = 9: a ≡ 12, f′(9) ≡ 9 ⇒ t ≡ −12·9^{-1} ≡ −12·2 ≡ 10 ⇒ x = 179.
- The four solutions modulo 289 are 110, 151, 155, 179; the least positive is 110. Direct check: 110^2 ≡ 251 (mod 289), so 110^4 ≡ 251^2 ≡ 288 (mod 289), hence 110^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289).

### Proof Structure:
1. Show any prime p with p | n^4 + 1 satisfies p ≡ 1 (mod 8); exclude p = 2.
2. Conclude the least possible p is 17.
3. Solve x^4 ≡ −1 (mod 17): roots are ±2, ±8; verify f′(x) ≠ 0 mod 17.
4. Apply Hensel’s lemma to lift each root to mod 17^2; compute lifts: 110, 151, 155, 179.
5. Conclude the least positive m with 17^2 | m^4 + 1 is 110.

C0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: 
- The least prime p with p^2 | n^4 + 1 must satisfy that −1 is a fourth power mod p, which requires p ≡ 1 (mod 8). The smallest such prime is p = 17. This is correct.
- The solution set modulo 17 for x^4 ≡ −1 is {±2, ±8}. Correct.
- In Hensel lifting, for f(x) = x^4 + 1, the lift x = r + 17t requires t ≡ −k · (f′(r))^−1 (mod 17), where k ≡ (r^4 + 1)/17 (mod 17). An error occurs if one assumes k ≡ 1 for all roots r; this holds for r = ±2 but not for r = ±8 (where k ≡ 3 mod 17).
- Previously reported lifted values like 134 and 179 are incorrect; the correct lifts from r = −2 and r = −8 are 151 and 196 respectively.

### Corrections: 
- Use Hensel’s lifting:
  - r = 2: k = 1, f′(2) = 15, (15)^−1 ≡ 8 ⇒ t ≡ −8 ≡ 9 ⇒ x = 2 + 17·9 = 155.
  - r = −2: k = 1, f′(−2) = 2, (2)^−1 ≡ 9 ⇒ t ≡ −9 ≡ 8 ⇒ x = 15 + 17·8 = 151.
  - r = 8: k ≡ 241 ≡ 3, f′(8) ≡ 8, (8)^−1 ≡ 15 ⇒ t ≡ −3·15 ≡ 6 ⇒ x = 8 + 17·6 = 110.
  - r = −8: k ≡ 3, f′(−8) ≡ 9, (9)^−1 ≡ 2 ⇒ t ≡ −3·2 ≡ 11 ⇒ x = 9 + 17·11 = 196.
- The four solutions modulo 289 are 110, 151, 155, 196. The least positive integer m with 17^2 | m^4 + 1 is 110.

C0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: We seek the least prime p such that there exists n with p^2 | n^4 + 1. This requires a solution to x^4 ≡ -1 mod p, which occurs iff p ≡ 1 mod 8. The smallest such prime is p = 17. By Hensel lifting, any solution mod 17 lifts uniquely to mod 17^2 since f'(x) = 4x^3 ≠ 0 mod 17 at solutions.

Solutions to x^4 ≡ -1 mod 17 are x ≡ ±2, ±8. Lifting each via j = -(f(x0)/p)·(f'(x0))^{-1} mod 17 and x1 = x0 + 17·j yields:
- x0 = 2 → x = 155
- x0 = 15 → x = 151
- x0 = 8 → x = 110
- x0 = 9 → x = 179

Thus the least positive m with 17^2 | m^4 + 1 is m = 110. Direct check: 110^4 + 1 = 146410001 = 17^2 · 506609 confirms divisibility by 289.

### Correctness Confirmation: The least prime is p = 17, and the least positive integer m with p^2 | m^4 + 1 is 110. Final answer: 110.

C0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: Verified the least prime p is 17, as it is the smallest prime with -1 a quartic residue (p ≡ 1 mod 8). Solutions to x^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17) are x ≡ 2, 8, 9, 15. Using Hensel lifting to mod 17^2 = 289 gives lifts: 2 → 155, 15 → 134, 8 → 110, 9 → 179. The least positive solution is 110. No inconsistencies found.

C0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning:
- For n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) to have a solution, the multiplicative order of n modulo p must be 8, so 8 | (p−1). The least such odd prime is p = 17.
- Since f(x) = x^4 + 1 has f′(x) = 4x^3 not divisible by 17 at any root modulo 17, Hensel’s lemma guarantees each solution modulo 17 lifts uniquely to a solution modulo 17^2 = 289.
- Solutions modulo 17 are x ≡ ±2, ±8. Lift each x0 to x = x0 + 17k satisfying f(x) ≡ 0 (mod 289) via k ≡ −(f(x0)/17) · (f′(x0))^{-1} (mod 17).
- Computations:
  - x0 = 2: k ≡ 9 ⇒ x = 155
  - x0 = 15: k ≡ 7 ⇒ x = 134
  - x0 = 8: k ≡ 6 ⇒ x = 110
  - x0 = 9: k ≡ 10 ⇒ x = 179
- The least positive among these is 110. Verification: 110^2 ≡ 251 (mod 289), hence 110^4 ≡ 251^2 ≡ −1 (mod 289), so 110^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289).

### Proof Structure:
1. Show necessity 8 | (p−1) for n^4 ≡ −1 (mod p); smallest such prime is p = 17.
2. Use Hensel’s lemma to lift roots from mod 17 to mod 289 due to f′(x) not vanishing at roots modulo 17.
3. Compute lifts for the four roots modulo 17; obtain candidates 110, 134, 155, 179 modulo 289.
4. Identify the minimal positive m = 110 and verify directly that 289 | 110^4 + 1.
