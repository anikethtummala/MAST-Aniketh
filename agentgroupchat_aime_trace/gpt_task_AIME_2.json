The lottery draws a random 4-subset B from S uniformly among C(10,4) = 210 possibilities.\\n- We want P(B = A | |A ∩ B| ≥ 2) = P(B = A) / P(|A ∩ B| ≥ 2), since B = A implies intersection size 4.\\n- P(B = A) = 1/210.\\n- Count the number of B with exactly k matches with A: C(4, k) · C(6, 4 − k).\\n  - For k ≥ 2: \\n    - k = 2: C(4,2)·C(6,2) = 6·15 = 90\\n    - k = 3: C(4,3)·C(6,1) = 4·6 = 24\\n    - k = 4: C(4,4)·C(6,0) = 1·1 = 1\\n  - Total favorable for “at least 2 matches” = 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.\\n- Therefore, P(|A ∩ B| ≥ 2) = 115/210.\\n\\nHence the conditional probability is (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115, so m/n = 1/115, and m + n = 116.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Model the draw as selecting a random 4-subset B from S; fix Jen’s 4-subset A.\\n2. Use conditional probability formula: P(B = A | |A ∩ B| ≥ 2) = P(B = A)/P(|A ∩ B| ≥ 2).\\n3. Compute numerator: P(B = A) = 1/C(10,4) = 1/210.\\n4. Compute denominator by counting intersections:\\n   - Exactly k common elements count: C(4,k)·C(6,4−k).\\n   - Sum for k = 2,3,4 gives 115 subsets, so probability = 115/210.\\n5.

The lottery draws a random 4-subset B from S uniformly among C(10,4) = 210 possibilities.\\n- We want P(B = A | |A ∩ B| ≥ 2) = P(B = A) / P(|A ∩ B| ≥ 2), since B = A implies intersection size 4.\\n- P(B = A) = 1/210.\\n- Count the number of B with exactly k matches with A: C(4, k) · C(6, 4 − k).\\n  - For k ≥ 2: \\n    - k = 2: C(4,2)·C(6,2) = 6·15 = 90\\n    - k = 3: C(4,3)·C(6,1) = 4·6 = 24\\n    - k = 4: C(4,4)·C(6,0) = 1·1 = 1\\n  - Total favorable for “at least 2 matches” = 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.\\n- Therefore, P(|A ∩ B| ≥ 2) = 115/210.\\n\\nHence the conditional probability is (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115, so m/n = 1/115, and m + n = 116.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Model the draw as selecting a random 4-subset B from S; fix Jen’s 4-subset A.\\n2. Use conditional probability formula: P(B = A | |A ∩ B| ≥ 2) = P(B = A)/P(|A ∩ B| ≥ 2).\\n3. Compute numerator: P(B = A) = 1/C(10,4) = 1/210.\\n4. Compute denominator by counting intersections:\\n   - Exactly k common elements count: C(4,k)·C(6,4−k).\\n   - Sum for k = 2,3,4 gives 115 subsets, so probability = 115/210.\\n5. Divide to get 1/115; thus m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.\\nC0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: \\nLet K be the number of matches between Jen’s fixed 4-number set and the random 4-number draw from {1,...,10}. Then K ~ Hypergeometric(N=10, K=4, n=4), so:\\n- P(K=4) = C(4,4)C(6,0)/C(10,4) = 1/210\\n- P(K=3) = C(4,3)C(6,1)/C(10,4) = 24/210\\n- P(K=2) = C(4,2)C(6,2)/C(10,4) = 90/210\\n\\nPrize event: K ≥ 2, so P(prize) = (1 + 24 + 90)/210 = 115/210.\\nGrand prize event: K = 4, so P(grand | prize) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.\\nThus m+n = 1+115 = 116.\\n\\n### Correctness Confirmation: \\nThe counting uses standard hypergeometric probabilities with correct parameters. The conditional probability is computed correctly, and the final result m+n = 116 is verified.\\nC0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: \\n- Let X be the number of matches between Jen’s 4 chosen numbers and the 4 randomly drawn numbers from S = {1,...,10}.

The lottery draws a random 4-subset B from S uniformly among C(10,4) = 210 possibilities.\\n- We want P(B = A | |A ∩ B| ≥ 2) = P(B = A) / P(|A ∩ B| ≥ 2), since B = A implies intersection size 4.\\n- P(B = A) = 1/210.\\n- Count the number of B with exactly k matches with A: C(4, k) · C(6, 4 − k).\\n  - For k ≥ 2: \\n    - k = 2: C(4,2)·C(6,2) = 6·15 = 90\\n    - k = 3: C(4,3)·C(6,1) = 4·6 = 24\\n    - k = 4: C(4,4)·C(6,0) = 1·1 = 1\\n  - Total favorable for “at least 2 matches” = 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.\\n- Therefore, P(|A ∩ B| ≥ 2) = 115/210.\\n\\nHence the conditional probability is (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115, so m/n = 1/115, and m + n = 116.\\n\\n### Proof Structure:\\n1. Model the draw as selecting a random 4-subset B from S; fix Jen’s 4-subset A.\\n2. Use conditional probability formula: P(B = A | |A ∩ B| ≥ 2) = P(B = A)/P(|A ∩ B| ≥ 2).\\n3. Compute numerator: P(B = A) = 1/C(10,4) = 1/210.\\n4. Compute denominator by counting intersections:\\n   - Exactly k common elements count: C(4,k)·C(6,4−k).\\n   - Sum for k = 2,3,4 gives 115 subsets, so probability = 115/210.\\n5.
