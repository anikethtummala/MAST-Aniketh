C0003 say to All: ### Context Analysis: 
We have 900 residents. Everyone owns candy hearts, and some own a diamond ring (D), golf clubs (G), and/or a garden spade (S). Counts are given for ownership of each single item and for residents owning exactly two or exactly three of the four items. We must find how many own all four. Since candy hearts are universal, owning all four is equivalent to owning all three of D, G, and S. The “exactly two/three of the four” translate to “exactly one/two of {D,G,S}” respectively.

### Key Information Summary:
- Total residents: 900
- Item sets:
  - D (diamond ring): |D| = 195
  - G (golf clubs): |G| = 367
  - S (garden spade): |S| = 562
  - H (candy hearts): universal (|H| = 900)
- Given exact counts among the four items:
  - Exactly two of the four = 437 → corresponds to exactly one of {D,G,S}: a1 = 437
  - Exactly three of the four = 234 → corresponds to exactly two of {D,G,S}: a2 = 234
  - All four = unknown → corresponds to exactly three of {D,G,S}: a3 = x
- Let a0 be number with none of {D,G,S} (hearts only).
- Equations:
  - Ownership summation over D,G,S: a1 + 2a2 + 3a3 = |D| + |G| + |S| = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124
  - Population partition: a0 + a1 + a2 + a3 = 900
- Goal: Solve for a3 = x (number owning all four).

C0002 say to All: ### Logical Reasoning: 
- Let A, B, C be ownership of diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade; hearts (H) are owned by all 900.
- Define for the three sets A,B,C: 
  - n1 = exactly one, n2 = exactly two, n3 = all three, n0 = none.
- “Exactly two of these things” among four corresponds to H plus exactly one of A,B,C, so n1 = 437.
- “Exactly three of these things” among four corresponds to H plus exactly two of A,B,C, so n2 = 234.
- Sum of individual memberships: |A|+|B|+|C| = 195+367+562 = 1124 = n1 + 2n2 + 3n3.
- Solve: 437 + 2·234 + 3n3 = 1124 ⇒ 905 + 3n3 = 1124 ⇒ n3 = 73.

### Proof Structure: 
1. Model ownership of three non-universal items (A,B,C); H is universal.
2. Map given “exactly k of four” to counts among A,B,C: n1=437, n2=234.
3. Use membership sum: n1 + 2n2 + 3n3 = 1124.
4. Compute n3 = (1124 − 437 − 2·234)/3 = 73.
5. Conclusion: 73 residents own all four items.

C0004 say to All: ### Calculations:
- Let D=195, G=367, S=562. Total D+G+S = 195+367+562 = 1124.
- Exactly two of the four items = 437 ⇒ exactly one of {D,G,S} = n1 = 437.
- Exactly three of the four items = 234 ⇒ exactly two of {D,G,S} = n2 = 234.
- Let n3 be number owning all three of {D,G,S} (thus all four items).
- Sum over sets: D+G+S = n1 + 2n2 + 3n3 ⇒ 1124 = 437 + 2*234 + 3n3 ⇒ 1124 = 905 + 3n3 ⇒ 3n3 = 219 ⇒ n3 = 73.
- Check: n0 = 900 - (n1+n2+n3) = 900 - (437+234+73) = 156 ≥ 0, consistent.

C0001 say to All: ### Error Analysis: 
- Since every resident owns candy hearts (C), “exactly two of the four” means exactly one of {D, G, S} and “exactly three of the four” means exactly two of {D, G, S}. Let n1=437 (exactly one of D,G,S), n2=234 (exactly two), n3=? (all three ⇔ all four items).
- Sum over set sizes: |D|+|G|+|S| = 195+367+562 = 1124 = n1 + 2n2 + 3n3 = 437 + 2*234 + 3n3 = 905 + 3n3 ⇒ 3n3 = 219 ⇒ n3 = 73.
- Consistency check: n0 (none of D,G,S) = 900 - (n1+n2+n3) = 900 - (437+234+73) = 156 ≥ 0. No contradictions.

### Corrections: 
No errors found. Final answer: 73

C0005 say to All: ### Solution Verification: Let xk be the number who own exactly k of the three items D, G, S. Since everyone owns H, the given counts map as: exactly two of the four = x1 = 437; exactly three of the four = x2 = 234; all four = x3 = ?. The sum of single counts is |D|+|G|+|S| = 195+367+562 = 1124, which equals x1 + 2x2 + 3x3. Thus 1124 = 437 + 2(234) + 3x3 = 905 + 3x3, giving x3 = 73. Consistency check: x0 = 900 − (437+234+73) = 156 ≥ 0 and 1124 = 437+468+219 holds.
