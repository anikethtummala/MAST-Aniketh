      "2.4 Information Withholding: \n",
      "This error occurs when an agent or group of agents possesses critical information but fails to share it promptly or effectively with other agents or system components that rely upon this information for their operations. The failure to disseminate relevant information may arise from ineffective or insufficient communication protocols, erroneous assumptions regarding the relevance or priority of the information, inadequate system coordination mechanisms, or deliberate withholding stemming from overly restrictive privacy policies or security constraints. Consequences of withholding relevant information can be severe, potentially leading to reduced operational efficiency, increased latency in task completion, unnecessary redundant processing, incorrect or suboptimal decision-making, and even complete system failures. Additionally, this error can significantly impair collaborative effectiveness, leading to misunderstandings, mistrust, or inefficiencies within the multi-agent environment. Furthermore, initial failures due to withheld information can trigger cascading errors, amplifying the negative impact on overall system performance and reliability. For instance, consider a scenario where a bug localization agent identifies a software defect, accurately determining the affected file and specific line number. The intended process requires this agent to immediately report such detailed bug information to a coding or repair agent responsible for addressing and resolving the issue. However, if the bug localization agent instead attempts to fix the bug independently without sharing the vital bug identification details with the coding agent, this withholding of relevant information could lead to duplicated effort, delayed resolution, incorrect fixes, or further system instability.\n",
