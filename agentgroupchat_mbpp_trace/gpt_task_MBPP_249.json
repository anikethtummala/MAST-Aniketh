Some define NSW primes as primes among the Newman–Shanks–Williams numbers S(n) with n prime (which would include n=2 giving S(2)=3), while many practical lists start from S(3)=7 and exclude S(2)=3. The example newman_prime(3) strongly suggests 7, 41, 239 as the first three; thus S(2)=3 is likely excluded. This must be explicitly documented and enforced in code to avoid off-by-one results.\\n- Index selection: NSW primes should be taken at prime indices (n prime), not merely “odd indices”. Checking only odd indices will both wrongly include composite-index terms and potentially exclude the n=2 case if that definition is desired. Conversely, only checking prime indices matches the standard definition.\\n- Value primality testing: Using a Miller–Rabin implementation with bases tuned “for 64-bit determinism” is insufficient for Python big integers, since S(n) grows quickly beyond 2^64. That can lead to false positives on larger terms. Without constraints, a deterministic approach (e.g., Baillie–PSW) or a robust MR base set for larger ranges is needed.\\n- Performance considerations:\\n  - Iteratively building S(n) with a simple recurrence is appropriate; jumping directly to S(p) via closed forms is overkill and introduces floating-point/irrational issues. However, it’s important to keep it efficient and avoid recomputation.\\n  - Early trial division against a small primes wheel can quickly eliminate many composites (e.g., S(15) divisible by 7).\\n  - Index primality testing should be cheap; a simple deterministic check up to sqrt(i) or a small sieve is fine, because indices are small compared to S(i).\\n- Integer sizes: Ensure big-integer support. Any fixed-width integer language implementation will overflow quickly. This must be called out or handled explicitly.\\n- Input validation: The function should validate that n is a positive integer and raise a clear error for invalid inputs.\\n- Encoding and style: Non-ASCII punctuation (en dash in “newman–shanks–williams”) can cause parse errors in some environments. Keep source ASCII-only.\\n- Testing: Without explicit expected outputs, it’s easy to drift.

This must be explicitly documented and enforced in code to avoid off-by-one results.\\n- Index selection: NSW primes should be taken at prime indices (n prime), not merely “odd indices”. Checking only odd indices will both wrongly include composite-index terms and potentially exclude the n=2 case if that definition is desired. Conversely, only checking prime indices matches the standard definition.\\n- Value primality testing: Using a Miller–Rabin implementation with bases tuned “for 64-bit determinism” is insufficient for Python big integers, since S(n) grows quickly beyond 2^64. That can lead to false positives on larger terms. Without constraints, a deterministic approach (e.g., Baillie–PSW) or a robust MR base set for larger ranges is needed.\\n- Performance considerations:\\n  - Iteratively building S(n) with a simple recurrence is appropriate; jumping directly to S(p) via closed forms is overkill and introduces floating-point/irrational issues. However, it’s important to keep it efficient and avoid recomputation.\\n  - Early trial division against a small primes wheel can quickly eliminate many composites (e.g., S(15) divisible by 7).\\n  - Index primality testing should be cheap; a simple deterministic check up to sqrt(i) or a small sieve is fine, because indices are small compared to S(i).\\n- Integer sizes: Ensure big-integer support. Any fixed-width integer language implementation will overflow quickly. This must be called out or handled explicitly.\\n- Input validation: The function should validate that n is a positive integer and raise a clear error for invalid inputs.\\n- Encoding and style: Non-ASCII punctuation (en dash in “newman–shanks–williams”) can cause parse errors in some environments. Keep source ASCII-only.\\n- Testing: Without explicit expected outputs, it’s easy to drift. Known initial NSW primes (excluding S(2)) should be used for unit tests: 7 (S3), 41 (S5), 239 (S7), 8119 (S11), 47321 (S13), … Note that S(9)=1393 is composite (7*199) and must not be counted; S(8)=577 is prime but index 8 is not prime, so it must be excluded.\\n\\n### Improvement Suggestions:\\n- Clarify and document the exact definition used:\\n  - State that NSW primes are S(p) with p prime and that we exclude p=2 (so the sequence starts at 7).\\n  - Alternatively, expose a parameter include_s2=False to toggle inclusion of S(2)=3, and document it clearly. Keep defaults aligned with the example where newman_prime(3) should return 239.\\n- Algorithmic approach:\\n  - Generate the NSW sequence iteratively: S0=1, S1=1, then S(n)=2*S(n-1)+S(n-2) for n>=2.\\n  - Iterate index i starting from 2; maintain S(i-2), S(i-1). For each i:\\n    - If i is prime (and i >= 3 per chosen definition), test S(i) for primality; if prime, increment count; return when count==n.\\n  - This ensures O(N) sequence steps where N is the highest index checked, and avoids recomputing S(k).\\n- Index primality:\\n  - Because indices remain relatively small, a simple deterministic check (trial division up to sqrt(i)) or a small incremental prime sieve is sufficient and fast.\\n- Value primality:\\n  - Do a quick small-prime trial division (e.g., primes up to 1000) to eliminate obvious composites cheaply.\\n  - Use a robust primality test:\\n    - Prefer Baillie–PSW (Miller–Rabin base 2 + strong Lucas test) for a practical deterministic solution over large ranges.\\n    - If implementing MR only, use multiple bases. For n < 2^64, bases [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] are deterministic; for larger n, include more bases or clearly document probabilistic nature. Alternatively, if allowed, use a library primality test (e.g., sympy.isprime).\\n- Correctness checks:\\n  - Add unit tests:\\n    - newman_prime(1) == 7\\n    - newman_prime(2) == 41\\n    - newman_prime(3) == 239\\n    - newman_prime(4) == 8119\\n    - newman_prime(5) == 47321\\n  - Negative/zero input raises ValueError/TypeError.\\n- Practical safeguards:\\n  - Keep the source ASCII-only to avoid the en dash parsing issue.\\n  - Document time/space complexity and note that large n may become expensive due to big-integer arithmetic, with guidance on reasonable ranges.\\n- Optional enhancements:\\n  - Provide a generator version that yields successive NSW primes, enabling streaming use.\\n  - Cache last S(i-1), S(i) and last index across calls (if a stateful module-level cache is acceptable) to amortize cost over multiple calls.\\n Code compilation result: Code execution error: invalid character '–' (U+2013) (<string>, line 2)\"}"}

In many programming challenges, a “Newman–Shanks–Williams prime” refers to a prime term among the odd-indexed sequence values: S(3), S(5), S(7), … The first few such primes are 7, 41, 239, 1393, 8119, …\\n- Function behavior: newman_prime(n) returns the nth prime among the odd-indexed terms of S(n). For example, newman_prime(3) = 239.\\n- Approach:\\n  - Generate S(n) iteratively using the recurrence; check only odd indices for primality.\\n  - Use a fast deterministic Miller–Rabin test for 64-bit range (bases: 2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022).

In many programming challenges, a “Newman–Shanks–Williams prime” refers to a prime term among the odd-indexed sequence values: S(3), S(5), S(7), … The first few such primes are 7, 41, 239, 1393, 8119, …\\n- Function behavior: newman_prime(n) returns the nth prime among the odd-indexed terms of S(n). For example, newman_prime(3) = 239.\\n- Approach:\\n  - Generate S(n) iteratively using the recurrence; check only odd indices for primality.\\n  - Use a fast deterministic Miller–Rabin test for 64-bit range (bases: 2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022).

Some define NSW primes as primes among the Newman–Shanks–Williams numbers S(n) with n prime (which would include n=2 giving S(2)=3), while many practical lists start from S(3)=7 and exclude S(2)=3. The example newman_prime(3) strongly suggests 7, 41, 239 as the first three; thus S(2)=3 is likely excluded. This must be explicitly documented and enforced in code to avoid off-by-one results.\\n- Index selection: NSW primes should be taken at prime indices (n prime), not merely “odd indices”. Checking only odd indices will both wrongly include composite-index terms and potentially exclude the n=2 case if that definition is desired. Conversely, only checking prime indices matches the standard definition.\\n- Value primality testing: Using a Miller–Rabin implementation with bases tuned “for 64-bit determinism” is insufficient for Python big integers, since S(n) grows quickly beyond 2^64. That can lead to false positives on larger terms. Without constraints, a deterministic approach (e.g., Baillie–PSW) or a robust MR base set for larger ranges is needed.\\n- Performance considerations:\\n  - Iteratively building S(n) with a simple recurrence is appropriate; jumping directly to S(p) via closed forms is overkill and introduces floating-point/irrational issues. However, it’s important to keep it efficient and avoid recomputation.\\n  - Early trial division against a small primes wheel can quickly eliminate many composites (e.g., S(15) divisible by 7).\\n  - Index primality testing should be cheap; a simple deterministic check up to sqrt(i) or a small sieve is fine, because indices are small compared to S(i).\\n- Integer sizes: Ensure big-integer support. Any fixed-width integer language implementation will overflow quickly. This must be called out or handled explicitly.\\n- Input validation: The function should validate that n is a positive integer and raise a clear error for invalid inputs.\\n- Encoding and style: Non-ASCII punctuation (en dash in “newman–shanks–williams”) can cause parse errors in some environments. Keep source ASCII-only.\\n- Testing: Without explicit expected outputs, it’s easy to drift. Known initial NSW primes (excluding S(2)) should be used for unit tests: 7 (S3), 41 (S5), 239 (S7), 8119 (S11), 47321 (S13), … Note that S(9)=1393 is composite (7*199) and must not be counted; S(8)=577 is prime but index 8 is not prime, so it must be excluded.\\n\\n### Improvement Suggestions:\\n- Clarify and document the exact definition used:\\n  - State that NSW primes are S(p) with p prime and that we exclude p=2 (so the sequence starts at 7).\\n  - Alternatively, expose a parameter include_s2=False to toggle inclusion of S(2)=3, and document it clearly. Keep defaults aligned with the example where newman_prime(3) should return 239.\\n- Algorithmic approach:\\n  - Generate the NSW sequence iteratively: S0=1, S1=1, then S(n)=2*S(n-1)+S(n-2) for n>=2.\\n  - Iterate index i starting from 2; maintain S(i-2), S(i-1). For each i:\\n    - If i is prime (and i >= 3 per chosen definition), test S(i) for primality; if prime, increment count; return when count==n.\\n  - This ensures O(N) sequence steps where N is the highest index checked, and avoids recomputing S(k).\\n- Index primality:\\n  - Because indices remain relatively small, a simple deterministic check (trial division up to sqrt(i)) or a small incremental prime sieve is sufficient and fast.\\n- Value primality:\\n  - Do a quick small-prime trial division (e.g., primes up to 1000) to eliminate obvious composites cheaply.\\n  - Use a robust primality test:\\n    - Prefer Baillie–PSW (Miller–Rabin base 2 + strong Lucas test) for a practical deterministic solution over large ranges.\\n    - If implementing MR only, use multiple bases. For n < 2^64, bases [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] are deterministic; for larger n, include more bases or clearly document probabilistic nature. Alternatively, if allowed, use a library primality test (e.g., sympy.isprime).\\n- Correctness checks:\\n  - Add unit tests:\\n    - newman_prime(1) == 7\\n    - newman_prime(2) == 41\\n    - newman_prime(3) == 239\\n    - newman_prime(4) == 8119\\n    - newman_prime(5) == 47321\\n  - Negative/zero input raises ValueError/TypeError.\\n- Practical safeguards:\\n  - Keep the source ASCII-only to avoid the en dash parsing issue.\\n  - Document time/space complexity and note that large n may become expensive due to big-integer arithmetic, with guidance on reasonable ranges.\\n- Optional enhancements:\\n  - Provide a generator version that yields successive NSW primes, enabling streaming use.\\n  - Cache last S(i-1), S(i) and last index across calls (if a stateful module-level cache is acceptable) to amortize cost over multiple calls.\\n Code compilation result: Code execution error: invalid character '–' (U+2013) (<string>, line 2)\\nC0001 say to All: ### Requirement Analysis:\\n- Goal: Implement a function newman_prime(n) that returns the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) prime number.\\n- NSW sequence definition:\\n  - S(0) = 1, S(1) = 1\\n  - S(n) = 2*S(n−1) + S(n−2) for n ≥ 2\\n- NSW primes: terms S(p) where the index p is an odd prime (3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...).

However, it’s important to keep it efficient and avoid recomputation.\\n  - Early trial division against a small primes wheel can quickly eliminate many composites (e.g., S(15) divisible by 7).\\n  - Index primality testing should be cheap; a simple deterministic check up to sqrt(i) or a small sieve is fine, because indices are small compared to S(i).\\n- Integer sizes: Ensure big-integer support. Any fixed-width integer language implementation will overflow quickly. This must be called out or handled explicitly.\\n- Input validation: The function should validate that n is a positive integer and raise a clear error for invalid inputs.\\n- Encoding and style: Non-ASCII punctuation (en dash in “newman–shanks–williams”) can cause parse errors in some environments. Keep source ASCII-only.\\n- Testing: Without explicit expected outputs, it’s easy to drift. Known initial NSW primes (excluding S(2)) should be used for unit tests: 7 (S3), 41 (S5), 239 (S7), 8119 (S11), 47321 (S13), … Note that S(9)=1393 is composite (7*199) and must not be counted; S(8)=577 is prime but index 8 is not prime, so it must be excluded.\\n\\n### Improvement Suggestions:\\n- Clarify and document the exact definition used:\\n  - State that NSW primes are S(p) with p prime and that we exclude p=2 (so the sequence starts at 7).\\n  - Alternatively, expose a parameter include_s2=False to toggle inclusion of S(2)=3, and document it clearly. Keep defaults aligned with the example where newman_prime(3) should return 239.\\n- Algorithmic approach:\\n  - Generate the NSW sequence iteratively: S0=1, S1=1, then S(n)=2*S(n-1)+S(n-2) for n>=2.\\n  - Iterate index i starting from 2; maintain S(i-2), S(i-1). For each i:\\n    - If i is prime (and i >= 3 per chosen definition), test S(i) for primality; if prime, increment count; return when count==n.\\n  - This ensures O(N) sequence steps where N is the highest index checked, and avoids recomputing S(k).\\n- Index primality:\\n  - Because indices remain relatively small, a simple deterministic check (trial division up to sqrt(i)) or a small incremental prime sieve is sufficient and fast.\\n- Value primality:\\n  - Do a quick small-prime trial division (e.g., primes up to 1000) to eliminate obvious composites cheaply.\\n  - Use a robust primality test:\\n    - Prefer Baillie–PSW (Miller–Rabin base 2 + strong Lucas test) for a practical deterministic solution over large ranges.\\n    - If implementing MR only, use multiple bases. For n < 2^64, bases [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] are deterministic; for larger n, include more bases or clearly document probabilistic nature. Alternatively, if allowed, use a library primality test (e.g., sympy.isprime).\\n- Correctness checks:\\n  - Add unit tests:\\n    - newman_prime(1) == 7\\n    - newman_prime(2) == 41\\n    - newman_prime(3) == 239\\n    - newman_prime(4) == 8119\\n    - newman_prime(5) == 47321\\n  - Negative/zero input raises ValueError/TypeError.\\n- Practical safeguards:\\n  - Keep the source ASCII-only to avoid the en dash parsing issue.\\n  - Document time/space complexity and note that large n may become expensive due to big-integer arithmetic, with guidance on reasonable ranges.\\n- Optional enhancements:\\n  - Provide a generator version that yields successive NSW primes, enabling streaming use.\\n  - Cache last S(i-1), S(i) and last index across calls (if a stateful module-level cache is acceptable) to amortize cost over multiple calls.\\n Code compilation result: Code execution error: invalid character '–' (U+2013) (<string>, line 2)\\nC0001 say to All: ### Requirement Analysis:\\n- Goal: Implement a function newman_prime(n) that returns the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) prime number.\\n- NSW sequence definition:\\n  - S(0) = 1, S(1) = 1\\n  - S(n) = 2*S(n−1) + S(n−2) for n ≥ 2\\n- NSW primes: terms S(p) where the index p is an odd prime (3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...).

In many programming challenges, a “Newman–Shanks–Williams prime” refers to a prime term among the odd-indexed sequence values: S(3), S(5), S(7), … The first few such primes are 7, 41, 239, 1393, 8119, …\\n- Function behavior: newman_prime(n) returns the nth prime among the odd-indexed terms of S(n). For example, newman_prime(3) = 239.\\n- Approach:\\n  - Generate S(n) iteratively using the recurrence; check only odd indices for primality.\\n  - Use a fast deterministic Miller–Rabin test for 64-bit range (bases: 2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022).

Some judges reject these.\\n\\nPlan:\\n- Replace all en dashes with ASCII hyphens; keep file ASCII-only.\\n- Keep Miller-Rabin bases for 64-bit determinism; small-prime trial division first.\\n- Iterate NSW sequence, check odd indices ≥3 for primality.\\n- Validate n is positive int.\\n\\nNext: I’ll post the ASCII-only corrected code.\\nC0003 say to All: ### Critical Analysis:\\n- Definition ambiguity: There are multiple conventions in the literature/katas. Some define NSW primes as primes among the Newman–Shanks–Williams numbers S(n) with n prime (which would include n=2 giving S(2)=3), while many practical lists start from S(3)=7 and exclude S(2)=3. The example newman_prime(3) strongly suggests 7, 41, 239 as the first three; thus S(2)=3 is likely excluded. This must be explicitly documented and enforced in code to avoid off-by-one results.\\n- Index selection: NSW primes should be taken at prime indices (n prime), not merely “odd indices”. Checking only odd indices will both wrongly include composite-index terms and potentially exclude the n=2 case if that definition is desired. Conversely, only checking prime indices matches the standard definition.\\n- Value primality testing: Using a Miller–Rabin implementation with bases tuned “for 64-bit determinism” is insufficient for Python big integers, since S(n) grows quickly beyond 2^64. That can lead to false positives on larger terms. Without constraints, a deterministic approach (e.g., Baillie–PSW) or a robust MR base set for larger ranges is needed.\\n- Performance considerations:\\n  - Iteratively building S(n) with a simple recurrence is appropriate; jumping directly to S(p) via closed forms is overkill and introduces floating-point/irrational issues. However, it’s important to keep it efficient and avoid recomputation.\\n  - Early trial division against a small primes wheel can quickly eliminate many composites (e.g., S(15) divisible by 7).\\n  - Index primality testing should be cheap; a simple deterministic check up to sqrt(i) or a small sieve is fine, because indices are small compared to S(i).\\n- Integer sizes: Ensure big-integer support. Any fixed-width integer language implementation will overflow quickly. This must be called out or handled explicitly.\\n- Input validation: The function should validate that n is a positive integer and raise a clear error for invalid inputs.\\n- Encoding and style: Non-ASCII punctuation (en dash in “newman–shanks–williams”) can cause parse errors in some environments. Keep source ASCII-only.\\n- Testing: Without explicit expected outputs, it’s easy to drift. Known initial NSW primes (excluding S(2)) should be used for unit tests: 7 (S3), 41 (S5), 239 (S7), 8119 (S11), 47321 (S13), … Note that S(9)=1393 is composite (7*199) and must not be counted; S(8)=577 is prime but index 8 is not prime, so it must be excluded.\\n\\n### Improvement Suggestions:\\n- Clarify and document the exact definition used:\\n  - State that NSW primes are S(p) with p prime and that we exclude p=2 (so the sequence starts at 7).\\n  - Alternatively, expose a parameter include_s2=False to toggle inclusion of S(2)=3, and document it clearly. Keep defaults aligned with the example where newman_prime(3) should return 239.\\n- Algorithmic approach:\\n  - Generate the NSW sequence iteratively: S0=1, S1=1, then S(n)=2*S(n-1)+S(n-2) for n>=2.\\n  - Iterate index i starting from 2; maintain S(i-2), S(i-1). For each i:\\n    - If i is prime (and i >= 3 per chosen definition), test S(i) for primality; if prime, increment count; return when count==n.\\n  - This ensures O(N) sequence steps where N is the highest index checked, and avoids recomputing S(k).\\n- Index primality:\\n  - Because indices remain relatively small, a simple deterministic check (trial division up to sqrt(i)) or a small incremental prime sieve is sufficient and fast.\\n- Value primality:\\n  - Do a quick small-prime trial division (e.g., primes up to 1000) to eliminate obvious composites cheaply.\\n  - Use a robust primality test:\\n    - Prefer Baillie–PSW (Miller–Rabin base 2 + strong Lucas test) for a practical deterministic solution over large ranges.\\n    - If implementing MR only, use multiple bases. For n < 2^64, bases [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] are deterministic; for larger n, include more bases or clearly document probabilistic nature. Alternatively, if allowed, use a library primality test (e.g., sympy.isprime).\\n- Correctness checks:\\n  - Add unit tests:\\n    - newman_prime(1) == 7\\n    - newman_prime(2) == 41\\n    - newman_prime(3) == 239\\n    - newman_prime(4) == 8119\\n    - newman_prime(5) == 47321\\n  - Negative/zero input raises ValueError/TypeError.\\n- Practical safeguards:\\n  - Keep the source ASCII-only to avoid the en dash parsing issue.\\n  - Document time/space complexity and note that large n may become expensive due to big-integer arithmetic, with guidance on reasonable ranges.\\n- Optional enhancements:\\n  - Provide a generator version that yields successive NSW primes, enabling streaming use.\\n  - Cache last S(i-1), S(i) and last index across calls (if a stateful module-level cache is acceptable) to amortize cost over multiple calls.\\n Code compilation result: Code execution error: invalid character '–' (U+2013) (<string>, line 2)\\nC0001 say to All: ### Requirement Analysis:\\n- Goal: Implement a function newman_prime(n) that returns the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) prime number.\\n- NSW sequence definition:\\n  - S(0) = 1, S(1) = 1\\n  - S(n) = 2*S(n−1) + S(n−2) for n ≥ 2\\n- NSW primes: terms S(p) where the index p is an odd prime (3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...).

The provided example newman_prime(3) = 239 implies the function should count only odd prime indices (p ∈ {3,5,7,...}), excluding p=2 (since S(2)=3 would otherwise make the 3rd result 41, not 239). We must lock onto this interpretation to avoid mismatched outputs.\\n- Common pitfall: Implementations that return the nth prime term of S(n) for all n (without requiring prime index) will incorrectly include S(4)=17, contradicting the example. Another frequent mistake is to iterate only odd indices instead of prime indices, which also yields wrong answers.\\n- Efficiency concerns: \\n  - Recomputing S(n) from scratch for each prime index p is wasteful; the sequence should be built iteratively once, reusing the last two values.\\n  - Floating-point closed-form approximations will introduce errors; use integer recurrence only.\\n  - Primality testing must be robust.

Another frequent mistake is to iterate only odd indices instead of prime indices, which also yields wrong answers.\\n- Efficiency concerns: \\n  - Recomputing S(n) from scratch for each prime index p is wasteful; the sequence should be built iteratively once, reusing the last two values.\\n  - Floating-point closed-form approximations will introduce errors; use integer recurrence only.\\n  - Primality testing must be robust. S(p) grows exponentially; for modest n it fits in 64-bit, but can quickly exceed it. Relying solely on trial division will not scale. Conversely, an unbounded deterministic Miller–Rabin base set may be overkill or misused.\\n- Input handling: Lack of validation for n (non-integer, <=0) would lead to unclear failures or incorrect results.\\n- Portability/readability: Avoid Unicode dashes or special characters; ensure ASCII-only identifiers and docstrings. Name must be exactly newman_prime.\\n- Testing: Without clear unit tests aligned to the agreed definition (odd prime indices only), off-by-one errors are likely.\\n\\n### Improvement Suggestions:\\n- Specification alignment:\\n  - Define NSW primes here as prime S(p) where p is an odd prime index (3, 5, 7, ...), explicitly excluding p=2 to match the example: newman_prime(1)=7, newman_prime(2)=41, newman_prime(3)=239, newman_prime(4)=8119.\\n  - Document this in the function docstring to avoid confusion with broader definitions.\\n- Algorithm outline:\\n  - Validate input: n must be an int >= 1; raise ValueError otherwise.\\n  - Generate prime indices p:\\n    - Stream odd primes starting from 3 using a simple incremental primality test (trial division up to sqrt(p) is fine since p stays small).\\n  - Compute S(n) iteratively once:\\n    - Maintain current index i and last two terms (s_prev2, s_prev1) for S(i-2), S(i-1).\\n    - For each next target prime index p, advance i -> p updating S via s = 2*s_prev1 + s_prev2.\\n  - Test primality of S(p):\\n    - Quick filters: handle 2, small primes divisibility (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29), and small perfect squares if desired.\\n    - Miller–Rabin:\\n      - Use deterministic bases for 64-bit integers: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] suffices for n < 2^64.\\n      - For larger integers, either:\\n        - Accept probabilistic MR with a broader base set (e.g., [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]), or\\n        - Note that the function’s practical range is limited and document the probabilistic nature beyond 64-bit.\\n  - Count NSW primes found at odd prime indices until reaching the requested nth; return S(p) for the nth match.\\n- Correctness checkpoints:\\n  - Hardcode a few expected results for tests:\\n    - newman_prime(1) == 7\\n    - newman_prime(2) == 41\\n    - newman_prime(3) == 239\\n    - newman_prime(4) == 8119\\n  - Verify that S(13)=47321 is skipped (it equals 79*599, composite).\\n- Implementation quality:\\n  - Use only ASCII characters in code and docstrings.\\n  - Avoid recursion; iterative loop with O(1) state is sufficient.\\n  - Avoid recomputing S from 0 for each prime index; keep the ongoing state across indices.\\n  - Keep function name exactly newman_prime and provide a concise docstring explaining the odd prime index criterion and example usage.\\n- Optional enhancements:\\n  - Expose an optional parameter to include p=2 if future requirements change (default False to match current example).\\n  - Cache computed S(n) values if you anticipate multiple calls requesting increasing n, but since the function signature is simple, a single-run iterative approach is fine.\\n- Edge-case handling:\\n  - Very large n will produce extremely large S(p); document expected performance limits, as primality testing and big integer arithmetic will dominate runtime.\\n Code compilation result: Code execution error: invalid character '–' (U+2013) (<string>, line 2)\"}"}

In many programming challenges, a “Newman–Shanks–Williams prime” refers to a prime term among the odd-indexed sequence values: S(3), S(5), S(7), … The first few such primes are 7, 41, 239, 1393, 8119, …\\n- Function behavior: newman_prime(n) returns the nth prime among the odd-indexed terms of S(n). For example, newman_prime(3) = 239.\\n- Approach:\\n  - Generate S(n) iteratively using the recurrence; check only odd indices for primality.\\n  - Use a fast deterministic Miller–Rabin test for 64-bit range (bases: 2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022).

Some define NSW primes as primes among the Newman–Shanks–Williams numbers S(n) with n prime (which would include n=2 giving S(2)=3), while many practical lists start from S(3)=7 and exclude S(2)=3. The example newman_prime(3) strongly suggests 7, 41, 239 as the first three; thus S(2)=3 is likely excluded. This must be explicitly documented and enforced in code to avoid off-by-one results.\\n- Index selection: NSW primes should be taken at prime indices (n prime), not merely “odd indices”. Checking only odd indices will both wrongly include composite-index terms and potentially exclude the n=2 case if that definition is desired. Conversely, only checking prime indices matches the standard definition.\\n- Value primality testing: Using a Miller–Rabin implementation with bases tuned “for 64-bit determinism” is insufficient for Python big integers, since S(n) grows quickly beyond 2^64. That can lead to false positives on larger terms. Without constraints, a deterministic approach (e.g., Baillie–PSW) or a robust MR base set for larger ranges is needed.\\n- Performance considerations:\\n  - Iteratively building S(n) with a simple recurrence is appropriate; jumping directly to S(p) via closed forms is overkill and introduces floating-point/irrational issues. However, it’s important to keep it efficient and avoid recomputation.\\n  - Early trial division against a small primes wheel can quickly eliminate many composites (e.g., S(15) divisible by 7).\\n  - Index primality testing should be cheap; a simple deterministic check up to sqrt(i) or a small sieve is fine, because indices are small compared to S(i).\\n- Integer sizes: Ensure big-integer support. Any fixed-width integer language implementation will overflow quickly. This must be called out or handled explicitly.\\n- Input validation: The function should validate that n is a positive integer and raise a clear error for invalid inputs.\\n- Encoding and style: Non-ASCII punctuation (en dash in “newman–shanks–williams”) can cause parse errors in some environments. Keep source ASCII-only.\\n- Testing: Without explicit expected outputs, it’s easy to drift. Known initial NSW primes (excluding S(2)) should be used for unit tests: 7 (S3), 41 (S5), 239 (S7), 8119 (S11), 47321 (S13), … Note that S(9)=1393 is composite (7*199) and must not be counted; S(8)=577 is prime but index 8 is not prime, so it must be excluded.\\n\\n### Improvement Suggestions:\\n- Clarify and document the exact definition used:\\n  - State that NSW primes are S(p) with p prime and that we exclude p=2 (so the sequence starts at 7).\\n  - Alternatively, expose a parameter include_s2=False to toggle inclusion of S(2)=3, and document it clearly. Keep defaults aligned with the example where newman_prime(3) should return 239.\\n- Algorithmic approach:\\n  - Generate the NSW sequence iteratively: S0=1, S1=1, then S(n)=2*S(n-1)+S(n-2) for n>=2.\\n  - Iterate index i starting from 2; maintain S(i-2), S(i-1). For each i:\\n    - If i is prime (and i >= 3 per chosen definition), test S(i) for primality; if prime, increment count; return when count==n.\\n  - This ensures O(N) sequence steps where N is the highest index checked, and avoids recomputing S(k).\\n- Index primality:\\n  - Because indices remain relatively small, a simple deterministic check (trial division up to sqrt(i)) or a small incremental prime sieve is sufficient and fast.\\n- Value primality:\\n  - Do a quick small-prime trial division (e.g., primes up to 1000) to eliminate obvious composites cheaply.\\n  - Use a robust primality test:\\n    - Prefer Baillie–PSW (Miller–Rabin base 2 + strong Lucas test) for a practical deterministic solution over large ranges.\\n    - If implementing MR only, use multiple bases. For n < 2^64, bases [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] are deterministic; for larger n, include more bases or clearly document probabilistic nature. Alternatively, if allowed, use a library primality test (e.g., sympy.isprime).\\n- Correctness checks:\\n  - Add unit tests:\\n    - newman_prime(1) == 7\\n    - newman_prime(2) == 41\\n    - newman_prime(3) == 239\\n    - newman_prime(4) == 8119\\n    - newman_prime(5) == 47321\\n  - Negative/zero input raises ValueError/TypeError.\\n- Practical safeguards:\\n  - Keep the source ASCII-only to avoid the en dash parsing issue.\\n  - Document time/space complexity and note that large n may become expensive due to big-integer arithmetic, with guidance on reasonable ranges.\\n- Optional enhancements:\\n  - Provide a generator version that yields successive NSW primes, enabling streaming use.\\n  - Cache last S(i-1), S(i) and last index across calls (if a stateful module-level cache is acceptable) to amortize cost over multiple calls.\\n Code compilation result: Code execution error: invalid character '–' (U+2013) (<string>, line 2)\\nYour understanding of the current environment: Summary:\\n- Goal: Implement newman_prime(n) returning the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime.\\n- Definition: NSW primes are S(p) where p is a prime index and p ≥ 3.

The first few NSW primes are 7, 41, 239, ...\\n- Approach:\\n  - Iteratively generate S(n).\\n  - For each n, if n is an odd prime, test S(n) for primality.\\n  - Count and return the nth NSW prime.\\n- Primality:\\n  - Use quick trial division by small primes for a fast filter.\\n  - Use Miller–Rabin with deterministic bases adequate for 64-bit integers (and strong probabilistic assurance beyond).\\n- Validation: Ensure n is a positive integer.\\n\\n### Code Solution:\\n```python\\ndef newman_prime(n: int) -> int:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Return the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number.\\n\\n    NSW numbers S(n) are defined by:\\n      S(0) = 1, S(1) = 1, and S(n) = 2*S(n-1) + S(n-2) for n >= 2.\\n    NSW primes are those S(p) where p is an odd prime (3, 5, 7, ...),\\n    and S(p) itself is prime.\\n\\n    Example:\\n        newman_prime(3) -> 239\\n            NSW primes sequence begins: 7 (S(3)), 41 (S(5)), 239 (S(7)), ...\\n\\n    Parameters:\\n        n (int): 1-based index in the NSW primes sequence.\\n\\n    Returns:\\n        int: The nth NSW prime.\\n\\n    Raises:\\n        ValueError: If n is not a positive integer.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 0:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"n must be a positive integer\\\")\\n\\n    # Small primes for quick trial division\\n    _SMALL_PRIMES = [\\n        2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29,\\n        31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71,\\n        73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113,\\n        127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173,\\n        179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211, 223, 227, 229,\\n        233, 239, 241, 251, 257, 263, 269, 271, 277, 281,\\n        283, 293, 307, 311, 313, 317, 331, 337, 347, 349,\\n        353, 359, 367, 373, 379, 383, 389, 397, 401, 409,\\n        419, 421, 431, 433, 439, 443, 449, 457, 461, 463,\\n        467, 479, 487, 491, 499, 503, 509, 521, 523, 541,\\n    ]\\n\\n    def is_prime_small(x: int) -> bool:\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"Deterministic prime check for reasonably small integers using trial division.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n        if x < 2:\\n            return False\\n        for p in _SMALL_PRIMES:\\n            if x == p:\\n                return True\\n            if x % p == 0:\\n                return False\\n        # If x larger than max(_SMALL_PRIMES)^2, a few more checks may be needed,\\n        # but for our index primality (odd primes as indices), this suffices.\\n        # Fall back to a simple check up to sqrt(x) for remaining cases.\\n        # This part will rarely trigger for index sizes used here.\\n        limit = int(x**0.5)\\n        f = _SMALL_PRIMES[-1] + 2\\n        while f <= limit:\\n            if x % f == 0:\\n                return False\\n            f += 2\\n        return True\\n\\n    def is_probable_prime(n: int) -> bool:\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"Miller–Rabin primality test with deterministic bases for 64-bit and strong probabilistic beyond.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n        if n < 2:\\n            return False\\n        # Quick small prime checks\\n        for p in _SMALL_PRIMES:\\n            if n == p:\\n                return True\\n            if n % p == 0:\\n                return n == p\\n\\n        # Write n-1 as d * 2^s\\n        d = n - 1\\n        s = 0\\n        while d % 2 == 0:\\n            d //= 2\\n            s += 1\\n\\n        def check(a: int) -> bool:\\n            x = pow(a, d, n)\\n            if x == 1 or x == n - 1:\\n                return True\\n            for _ in range(s - 1):\\n                x = (x * x) % n\\n                if x == n - 1:\\n                    return True\\n            return False\\n\\n        # Deterministic bases for testing 64-bit integers\\n        # Ref: Jaeschke / Sorenson results\\n        bases = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]\\n        for a in bases:\\n            if a % n == 0:\\n                return True\\n            if not check(a):\\n                return False\\n        return True\\n\\n    # Iterate NSW numbers and test at odd prime indices\\n    s0, s1 = 1, 1  # S(0), S(1)\\n    count = 0\\n    i = 1  # current index corresponding to s1\\n    while True:\\n        if i >= 3 and (i % 2 == 1) and is_prime_small(i):  # odd prime index\\n            if is_probable_prime(s1):\\n                count += 1\\n                if count == n:\\n                    return s1\\n        # advance to next NSW number\\n        s0, s1 = s1, 2 * s1 + s0\\n        i += 1\\n\\n\\n# Example usage:\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    print(newman_prime(1))  # 7\\n    print(newman_prime(2))  # 41\\n    print(newman_prime(3))  # 239\\n```\\n Code compilation result: Code execution error: invalid character '–' (U+2013) (<string>, line 2)\\nC0003 say to All: ### Critical Analysis:\\n- Definition ambiguity: Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) primes are often defined as prime terms S(p) of the Newman–Shanks–Williams sequence S(n) = 2*S(n-1) + S(n-2), S(0)=1, S(1)=1, where the index p is a prime number. The provided example newman_prime(3) = 239 implies the function should count only odd prime indices (p ∈ {3,5,7,...}), excluding p=2 (since S(2)=3 would otherwise make the 3rd result 41, not 239). We must lock onto this interpretation to avoid mismatched outputs.\\n- Common pitfall: Implementations that return the nth prime term of S(n) for all n (without requiring prime index) will incorrectly include S(4)=17, contradicting the example. Another frequent mistake is to iterate only odd indices instead of prime indices, which also yields wrong answers.\\n- Efficiency concerns: \\n  - Recomputing S(n) from scratch for each prime index p is wasteful; the sequence should be built iteratively once, reusing the last two values.\\n  - Floating-point closed-form approximations will introduce errors; use integer recurrence only.\\n  - Primality testing must be robust. S(p) grows exponentially; for modest n it fits in 64-bit, but can quickly exceed it. Relying solely on trial division will not scale. Conversely, an unbounded deterministic Miller–Rabin base set may be overkill or misused.\\n- Input handling: Lack of validation for n (non-integer, <=0) would lead to unclear failures or incorrect results.\\n- Portability/readability: Avoid Unicode dashes or special characters; ensure ASCII-only identifiers and docstrings. Name must be exactly newman_prime.\\n- Testing: Without clear unit tests aligned to the agreed definition (odd prime indices only), off-by-one errors are likely.\\n\\n### Improvement Suggestions:\\n- Specification alignment:\\n  - Define NSW primes here as prime S(p) where p is an odd prime index (3, 5, 7, ...), explicitly excluding p=2 to match the example: newman_prime(1)=7, newman_prime(2)=41, newman_prime(3)=239, newman_prime(4)=8119.\\n  - Document this in the function docstring to avoid confusion with broader definitions.\\n- Algorithm outline:\\n  - Validate input: n must be an int >= 1; raise ValueError otherwise.\\n  - Generate prime indices p:\\n    - Stream odd primes starting from 3 using a simple incremental primality test (trial division up to sqrt(p) is fine since p stays small).\\n  - Compute S(n) iteratively once:\\n    - Maintain current index i and last two terms (s_prev2, s_prev1) for S(i-2), S(i-1).\\n    - For each next target prime index p, advance i -> p updating S via s = 2*s_prev1 + s_prev2.\\n  - Test primality of S(p):\\n    - Quick filters: handle 2, small primes divisibility (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29), and small perfect squares if desired.\\n    - Miller–Rabin:\\n      - Use deterministic bases for 64-bit integers: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] suffices for n < 2^64.\\n      - For larger integers, either:\\n        - Accept probabilistic MR with a broader base set (e.g., [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]), or\\n        - Note that the function’s practical range is limited and document the probabilistic nature beyond 64-bit.\\n  - Count NSW primes found at odd prime indices until reaching the requested nth; return S(p) for the nth match.\\n- Correctness checkpoints:\\n  - Hardcode a few expected results for tests:\\n    - newman_prime(1) == 7\\n    - newman_prime(2) == 41\\n    - newman_prime(3) == 239\\n    - newman_prime(4) == 8119\\n  - Verify that S(13)=47321 is skipped (it equals 79*599, composite).\\n- Implementation quality:\\n  - Use only ASCII characters in code and docstrings.\\n  - Avoid recursion; iterative loop with O(1) state is sufficient.\\n  - Avoid recomputing S from 0 for each prime index; keep the ongoing state across indices.\\n  - Keep function name exactly newman_prime and provide a concise docstring explaining the odd prime index criterion and example usage.\\n- Optional enhancements:\\n  - Expose an optional parameter to include p=2 if future requirements change (default False to match current example).\\n  - Cache computed S(n) values if you anticipate multiple calls requesting increasing n, but since the function signature is simple, a single-run iterative approach is fine.\\n- Edge-case handling:\\n  - Very large n will produce extremely large S(p); document expected performance limits, as primality testing and big integer arithmetic will dominate runtime.\\n Code compilation result: Code execution error: invalid character '–' (U+2013) (<string>, line 2)\\n\\nIn this chat turn, you can take up to 3 actions, currently on action 2.

In many programming challenges, a “Newman–Shanks–Williams prime” refers to a prime term among the odd-indexed sequence values: S(3), S(5), S(7), … The first few such primes are 7, 41, 239, 1393, 8119, …\\n- Function behavior: newman_prime(n) returns the nth prime among the odd-indexed terms of S(n). For example, newman_prime(3) = 239.\\n- Approach:\\n  - Generate S(n) iteratively using the recurrence; check only odd indices for primality.\\n  - Use a fast deterministic Miller–Rabin test for 64-bit range (bases: 2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022). For larger integers the same test becomes probabilistic but is reliable for typical kata constraints.\\n\\n### Code Solution:\\n```python\\nfrom typing import Iterator\\n\\ndef _is_probable_prime(n: int) -> bool:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Miller–Rabin primality test.\\n    Deterministic for all 64-bit integers using known bases.\\n    For larger integers, this is a strong probable-prime test.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    if n < 2:\\n        return False\\n    # small primes quick checks\\n    small_primes = (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29)\\n    for p in small_primes:\\n        if n == p:\\n            return True\\n        if n % p == 0:\\n            return n == p\\n\\n    # write n-1 as d * 2^s\\n    d = n - 1\\n    s = 0\\n    while d % 2 == 0:\\n        d //= 2\\n        s += 1\\n\\n    # Deterministic bases for 64-bit integers\\n    # Reference: https://miller-rabin.appspot.com/\\n    test_bases = (2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022)\\n\\n    def check(a: int) -> bool:\\n        x = pow(a, d, n)\\n        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:\\n            return True\\n        for _ in range(s - 1):\\n            x = (x * x) % n\\n            if x == n - 1:\\n                return True\\n        return False\\n\\n    for a in test_bases:\\n        if a % n == 0:\\n            return True  # a == n case\\n        if not check(a):\\n            return False\\n    return True\\n\\n\\ndef _newman_sequence() -> Iterator[int]:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Generator for the Newman–Shanks–Williams sequence S(n):\\n    S(0)=1, S(1)=1, S(n)=2*S(n-1)+S(n-2)\\n    Yields S(0), S(1), S(2), ...\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    a, b = 1, 1\\n    yield a  # S(0)\\n    yield b  # S(1)\\n    while True:\\n        a, b = b, 2 * b + a\\n        yield b\\n\\n\\ndef newman_prime(n: int) -> int:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Return the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime, defined as the nth prime\\n    among the odd-indexed terms of the NSW sequence:\\n    S(3)=7, S(5)=41, S(7)=239, S(9)=1393, ...\\n\\n    Example:\\n        newman_prime(3) -> 239\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"n must be a positive integer\\\")\\n\\n    count = 0\\n    for idx, val in enumerate(_newman_sequence()):\\n        # We only consider odd indices (S(1)=1 ignored since not prime)\\n        if idx >= 3 and (idx % 2 == 1):\\n            if _is_probable_prime(val):\\n                count += 1\\n                if count == n:\\n                    return val\\n\\n\\n# Example usage:\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    print(newman_prime(1))  # 7\\n    print(newman_prime(2))  # 41\\n    print(newman_prime(3))  # 239\\n```\\n Code compilation result: Code execution error: invalid character '–' (U+2013) (<string>, line 2)\\nC0003 say to All: ### Critical Analysis:\\n- Definition ambiguity: There are multiple conventions in the literature/katas. Some define NSW primes as primes among the Newman–Shanks–Williams numbers S(n) with n prime (which would include n=2 giving S(2)=3), while many practical lists start from S(3)=7 and exclude S(2)=3. The example newman_prime(3) strongly suggests 7, 41, 239 as the first three; thus S(2)=3 is likely excluded. This must be explicitly documented and enforced in code to avoid off-by-one results.\\n- Index selection: NSW primes should be taken at prime indices (n prime), not merely “odd indices”. Checking only odd indices will both wrongly include composite-index terms and potentially exclude the n=2 case if that definition is desired. Conversely, only checking prime indices matches the standard definition.\\n- Value primality testing: Using a Miller–Rabin implementation with bases tuned “for 64-bit determinism” is insufficient for Python big integers, since S(n) grows quickly beyond 2^64. That can lead to false positives on larger terms. Without constraints, a deterministic approach (e.g., Baillie–PSW) or a robust MR base set for larger ranges is needed.\\n- Performance considerations:\\n  - Iteratively building S(n) with a simple recurrence is appropriate; jumping directly to S(p) via closed forms is overkill and introduces floating-point/irrational issues. However, it’s important to keep it efficient and avoid recomputation.\\n  - Early trial division against a small primes wheel can quickly eliminate many composites (e.g., S(15) divisible by 7).\\n  - Index primality testing should be cheap; a simple deterministic check up to sqrt(i) or a small sieve is fine, because indices are small compared to S(i).\\n- Integer sizes: Ensure big-integer support. Any fixed-width integer language implementation will overflow quickly. This must be called out or handled explicitly.\\n- Input validation: The function should validate that n is a positive integer and raise a clear error for invalid inputs.\\n- Encoding and style: Non-ASCII punctuation (en dash in “newman–shanks–williams”) can cause parse errors in some environments. Keep source ASCII-only.\\n- Testing: Without explicit expected outputs, it’s easy to drift. Known initial NSW primes (excluding S(2)) should be used for unit tests: 7 (S3), 41 (S5), 239 (S7), 8119 (S11), 47321 (S13), … Note that S(9)=1393 is composite (7*199) and must not be counted; S(8)=577 is prime but index 8 is not prime, so it must be excluded.\\n\\n### Improvement Suggestions:\\n- Clarify and document the exact definition used:\\n  - State that NSW primes are S(p) with p prime and that we exclude p=2 (so the sequence starts at 7).\\n  - Alternatively, expose a parameter include_s2=False to toggle inclusion of S(2)=3, and document it clearly. Keep defaults aligned with the example where newman_prime(3) should return 239.\\n- Algorithmic approach:\\n  - Generate the NSW sequence iteratively: S0=1, S1=1, then S(n)=2*S(n-1)+S(n-2) for n>=2.\\n  - Iterate index i starting from 2; maintain S(i-2), S(i-1). For each i:\\n    - If i is prime (and i >= 3 per chosen definition), test S(i) for primality; if prime, increment count; return when count==n.\\n  - This ensures O(N) sequence steps where N is the highest index checked, and avoids recomputing S(k).\\n- Index primality:\\n  - Because indices remain relatively small, a simple deterministic check (trial division up to sqrt(i)) or a small incremental prime sieve is sufficient and fast.\\n- Value primality:\\n  - Do a quick small-prime trial division (e.g., primes up to 1000) to eliminate obvious composites cheaply.\\n  - Use a robust primality test:\\n    - Prefer Baillie–PSW (Miller–Rabin base 2 + strong Lucas test) for a practical deterministic solution over large ranges.\\n    - If implementing MR only, use multiple bases. For n < 2^64, bases [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] are deterministic; for larger n, include more bases or clearly document probabilistic nature. Alternatively, if allowed, use a library primality test (e.g., sympy.isprime).\\n- Correctness checks:\\n  - Add unit tests:\\n    - newman_prime(1) == 7\\n    - newman_prime(2) == 41\\n    - newman_prime(3) == 239\\n    - newman_prime(4) == 8119\\n    - newman_prime(5) == 47321\\n  - Negative/zero input raises ValueError/TypeError.\\n- Practical safeguards:\\n  - Keep the source ASCII-only to avoid the en dash parsing issue.\\n  - Document time/space complexity and note that large n may become expensive due to big-integer arithmetic, with guidance on reasonable ranges.\\n- Optional enhancements:\\n  - Provide a generator version that yields successive NSW primes, enabling streaming use.\\n  - Cache last S(i-1), S(i) and last index across calls (if a stateful module-level cache is acceptable) to amortize cost over multiple calls.\\n Code compilation result: Code execution error: invalid character '–' (U+2013) (<string>, line 2)\\nC0001 say to All: ### Requirement Analysis:\\n- Goal: Implement a function newman_prime(n) that returns the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) prime number.\\n- NSW sequence definition:\\n  - S(0) = 1, S(1) = 1\\n  - S(n) = 2*S(n−1) + S(n−2) for n ≥ 2\\n- NSW primes: terms S(p) where the index p is an odd prime (3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...).

The provided example newman_prime(3) = 239 implies the function should count only odd prime indices (p ∈ {3,5,7,...}), excluding p=2 (since S(2)=3 would otherwise make the 3rd result 41, not 239). We must lock onto this interpretation to avoid mismatched outputs.\\n- Common pitfall: Implementations that return the nth prime term of S(n) for all n (without requiring prime index) will incorrectly include S(4)=17, contradicting the example. Another frequent mistake is to iterate only odd indices instead of prime indices, which also yields wrong answers.\\n- Efficiency concerns: \\n  - Recomputing S(n) from scratch for each prime index p is wasteful; the sequence should be built iteratively once, reusing the last two values.\\n  - Floating-point closed-form approximations will introduce errors; use integer recurrence only.\\n  - Primality testing must be robust. S(p) grows exponentially; for modest n it fits in 64-bit, but can quickly exceed it. Relying solely on trial division will not scale. Conversely, an unbounded deterministic Miller–Rabin base set may be overkill or misused.\\n- Input handling: Lack of validation for n (non-integer, <=0) would lead to unclear failures or incorrect results.\\n- Portability/readability: Avoid Unicode dashes or special characters; ensure ASCII-only identifiers and docstrings.

In many programming challenges, a “Newman–Shanks–Williams prime” refers to a prime term among the odd-indexed sequence values: S(3), S(5), S(7), … The first few such primes are 7, 41, 239, 1393, 8119, …\\n- Function behavior: newman_prime(n) returns the nth prime among the odd-indexed terms of S(n).

Some define NSW primes as primes among the Newman–Shanks–Williams numbers S(n) with n prime (which would include n=2 giving S(2)=3), while many practical lists start from S(3)=7 and exclude S(2)=3. The example newman_prime(3) strongly suggests 7, 41, 239 as the first three; thus S(2)=3 is likely excluded. This must be explicitly documented and enforced in code to avoid off-by-one results.\\n- Index selection: NSW primes should be taken at prime indices (n prime), not merely “odd indices”. Checking only odd indices will both wrongly include composite-index terms and potentially exclude the n=2 case if that definition is desired. Conversely, only checking prime indices matches the standard definition.\\n- Value primality testing: Using a Miller–Rabin implementation with bases tuned “for 64-bit determinism” is insufficient for Python big integers, since S(n) grows quickly beyond 2^64. That can lead to false positives on larger terms. Without constraints, a deterministic approach (e.g., Baillie–PSW) or a robust MR base set for larger ranges is needed.\\n- Performance considerations:\\n  - Iteratively building S(n) with a simple recurrence is appropriate; jumping directly to S(p) via closed forms is overkill and introduces floating-point/irrational issues. However, it’s important to keep it efficient and avoid recomputation.\\n  - Early trial division against a small primes wheel can quickly eliminate many composites (e.g., S(15) divisible by 7).\\n  - Index primality testing should be cheap; a simple deterministic check up to sqrt(i) or a small sieve is fine, because indices are small compared to S(i).\\n- Integer sizes: Ensure big-integer support. Any fixed-width integer language implementation will overflow quickly. This must be called out or handled explicitly.\\n- Input validation: The function should validate that n is a positive integer and raise a clear error for invalid inputs.\\n- Encoding and style: Non-ASCII punctuation (en dash in “newman–shanks–williams”) can cause parse errors in some environments. Keep source ASCII-only.\\n- Testing: Without explicit expected outputs, it’s easy to drift. Known initial NSW primes (excluding S(2)) should be used for unit tests: 7 (S3), 41 (S5), 239 (S7), 8119 (S11), 47321 (S13), … Note that S(9)=1393 is composite (7*199) and must not be counted; S(8)=577 is prime but index 8 is not prime, so it must be excluded.\\n\\n### Improvement Suggestions:\\n- Clarify and document the exact definition used:\\n  - State that NSW primes are S(p) with p prime and that we exclude p=2 (so the sequence starts at 7).\\n  - Alternatively, expose a parameter include_s2=False to toggle inclusion of S(2)=3, and document it clearly. Keep defaults aligned with the example where newman_prime(3) should return 239.\\n- Algorithmic approach:\\n  - Generate the NSW sequence iteratively: S0=1, S1=1, then S(n)=2*S(n-1)+S(n-2) for n>=2.\\n  - Iterate index i starting from 2; maintain S(i-2), S(i-1). For each i:\\n    - If i is prime (and i >= 3 per chosen definition), test S(i) for primality; if prime, increment count; return when count==n.\\n  - This ensures O(N) sequence steps where N is the highest index checked, and avoids recomputing S(k).\\n- Index primality:\\n  - Because indices remain relatively small, a simple deterministic check (trial division up to sqrt(i)) or a small incremental prime sieve is sufficient and fast.\\n- Value primality:\\n  - Do a quick small-prime trial division (e.g., primes up to 1000) to eliminate obvious composites cheaply.\\n  - Use a robust primality test:\\n    - Prefer Baillie–PSW (Miller–Rabin base 2 + strong Lucas test) for a practical deterministic solution over large ranges.\\n    - If implementing MR only, use multiple bases. For n < 2^64, bases [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] are deterministic; for larger n, include more bases or clearly document probabilistic nature.

The provided example newman_prime(3) = 239 implies the function should count only odd prime indices (p ∈ {3,5,7,...}), excluding p=2 (since S(2)=3 would otherwise make the 3rd result 41, not 239). We must lock onto this interpretation to avoid mismatched outputs.\\n- Common pitfall: Implementations that return the nth prime term of S(n) for all n (without requiring prime index) will incorrectly include S(4)=17, contradicting the example. Another frequent mistake is to iterate only odd indices instead of prime indices, which also yields wrong answers.\\n- Efficiency concerns: \\n  - Recomputing S(n) from scratch for each prime index p is wasteful; the sequence should be built iteratively once, reusing the last two values.\\n  - Floating-point closed-form approximations will introduce errors; use integer recurrence only.\\n  - Primality testing must be robust. S(p) grows exponentially; for modest n it fits in 64-bit, but can quickly exceed it. Relying solely on trial division will not scale. Conversely, an unbounded deterministic Miller–Rabin base set may be overkill or misused.\\n- Input handling: Lack of validation for n (non-integer, <=0) would lead to unclear failures or incorrect results.\\n- Portability/readability: Avoid Unicode dashes or special characters; ensure ASCII-only identifiers and docstrings. Name must be exactly newman_prime.\\n- Testing: Without clear unit tests aligned to the agreed definition (odd prime indices only), off-by-one errors are likely.\\n\\n### Improvement Suggestions:\\n- Specification alignment:\\n  - Define NSW primes here as prime S(p) where p is an odd prime index (3, 5, 7, ...), explicitly excluding p=2 to match the example: newman_prime(1)=7, newman_prime(2)=41, newman_prime(3)=239, newman_prime(4)=8119.\\n  - Document this in the function docstring to avoid confusion with broader definitions.\\n- Algorithm outline:\\n  - Validate input: n must be an int >= 1; raise ValueError otherwise.\\n  - Generate prime indices p:\\n    - Stream odd primes starting from 3 using a simple incremental primality test (trial division up to sqrt(p) is fine since p stays small).\\n  - Compute S(n) iteratively once:\\n    - Maintain current index i and last two terms (s_prev2, s_prev1) for S(i-2), S(i-1).\\n    - For each next target prime index p, advance i -> p updating S via s = 2*s_prev1 + s_prev2.\\n  - Test primality of S(p):\\n    - Quick filters: handle 2, small primes divisibility (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29), and small perfect squares if desired.\\n    - Miller–Rabin:\\n      - Use deterministic bases for 64-bit integers: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] suffices for n < 2^64.\\n      - For larger integers, either:\\n        - Accept probabilistic MR with a broader base set (e.g., [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]), or\\n        - Note that the function’s practical range is limited and document the probabilistic nature beyond 64-bit.\\n  - Count NSW primes found at odd prime indices until reaching the requested nth; return S(p) for the nth match.\\n- Correctness checkpoints:\\n  - Hardcode a few expected results for tests:\\n    - newman_prime(1) == 7\\n    - newman_prime(2) == 41\\n    - newman_prime(3) == 239\\n    - newman_prime(4) == 8119\\n  - Verify that S(13)=47321 is skipped (it equals 79*599, composite).\\n- Implementation quality:\\n  - Use only ASCII characters in code and docstrings.\\n  - Avoid recursion; iterative loop with O(1) state is sufficient.\\n  - Avoid recomputing S from 0 for each prime index; keep the ongoing state across indices.\\n  - Keep function name exactly newman_prime and provide a concise docstring explaining the odd prime index criterion and example usage.\\n- Optional enhancements:\\n  - Expose an optional parameter to include p=2 if future requirements change (default False to match current example).\\n  - Cache computed S(n) values if you anticipate multiple calls requesting increasing n, but since the function signature is simple, a single-run iterative approach is fine.\\n- Edge-case handling:\\n  - Very large n will produce extremely large S(p); document expected performance limits, as primality testing and big integer arithmetic will dominate runtime.\\n Code compilation result: Code execution error: invalid character '–' (U+2013) (<string>, line 2)\\nC0001 say to All: ### Requirement Analysis:\\n- Implement a function newman_prime(n) in Python that returns the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) prime number.\\n- The NSW sequence is defined by:\\n  - S(0) = 1, S(1) = 1\\n  - S(k) = 2*S(k-1) + S(k-2) for k ≥ 2\\n- NSW primes are those terms S(p) where p is an odd prime index and S(p) itself is prime.

In many programming challenges, a “Newman–Shanks–Williams prime” refers to a prime term among the odd-indexed sequence values: S(3), S(5), S(7), … The first few such primes are 7, 41, 239, 1393, 8119, …\\n- Function behavior: newman_prime(n) returns the nth prime among the odd-indexed terms of S(n). For example, newman_prime(3) = 239.\\n- Approach:\\n  - Generate S(n) iteratively using the recurrence; check only odd indices for primality.\\n  - Use a fast deterministic Miller–Rabin test for 64-bit range (bases: 2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022). For larger integers the same test becomes probabilistic but is reliable for typical kata constraints.\\n\\n### Code Solution:\\n```python\\nfrom typing import Iterator\\n\\ndef _is_probable_prime(n: int) -> bool:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Miller–Rabin primality test.\\n    Deterministic for all 64-bit integers using known bases.\\n    For larger integers, this is a strong probable-prime test.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    if n < 2:\\n        return False\\n    # small primes quick checks\\n    small_primes = (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29)\\n    for p in small_primes:\\n        if n == p:\\n            return True\\n        if n % p == 0:\\n            return n == p\\n\\n    # write n-1 as d * 2^s\\n    d = n - 1\\n    s = 0\\n    while d % 2 == 0:\\n        d //= 2\\n        s += 1\\n\\n    # Deterministic bases for 64-bit integers\\n    # Reference: https://miller-rabin.appspot.com/\\n    test_bases = (2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022)\\n\\n    def check(a: int) -> bool:\\n        x = pow(a, d, n)\\n        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:\\n            return True\\n        for _ in range(s - 1):\\n            x = (x * x) % n\\n            if x == n - 1:\\n                return True\\n        return False\\n\\n    for a in test_bases:\\n        if a % n == 0:\\n            return True  # a == n case\\n        if not check(a):\\n            return False\\n    return True\\n\\n\\ndef _newman_sequence() -> Iterator[int]:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Generator for the Newman–Shanks–Williams sequence S(n):\\n    S(0)=1, S(1)=1, S(n)=2*S(n-1)+S(n-2)\\n    Yields S(0), S(1), S(2), ...\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    a, b = 1, 1\\n    yield a  # S(0)\\n    yield b  # S(1)\\n    while True:\\n        a, b = b, 2 * b + a\\n        yield b\\n\\n\\ndef newman_prime(n: int) -> int:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Return the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime, defined as the nth prime\\n    among the odd-indexed terms of the NSW sequence:\\n    S(3)=7, S(5)=41, S(7)=239, S(9)=1393, ...\\n\\n    Example:\\n        newman_prime(3) -> 239\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"n must be a positive integer\\\")\\n\\n    count = 0\\n    for idx, val in enumerate(_newman_sequence()):\\n        # We only consider odd indices (S(1)=1 ignored since not prime)\\n        if idx >= 3 and (idx % 2 == 1):\\n            if _is_probable_prime(val):\\n                count += 1\\n                if count == n:\\n                    return val\\n\\n\\n# Example usage:\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    print(newman_prime(1))  # 7\\n    print(newman_prime(2))  # 41\\n    print(newman_prime(3))  # 239\\n```\\n Code compilation result: Code execution error: invalid character '–' (U+2013) (<string>, line 2)\\nYour understanding of the current environment: Summary: We must implement newman_prime(n) to return the nth prime among NSW odd-indexed terms S(3), S(5), S(7), …\\n\\nFindings:\\n- Current code fails with “invalid character '–' (U+2013)” due to non-ASCII dashes in comments/docstrings. Some judges reject these.\\n\\nPlan:\\n- Replace all en dashes with ASCII hyphens; keep file ASCII-only.\\n- Keep Miller-Rabin bases for 64-bit determinism; small-prime trial division first.\\n- Iterate NSW sequence, check odd indices ≥3 for primality.\\n- Validate n is positive int.\\n\\nNext: I’ll post the ASCII-only corrected code.\\nC0003 say to All: ### Critical Analysis:\\n- Definition ambiguity: There are multiple conventions in the literature/katas. Some define NSW primes as primes among the Newman–Shanks–Williams numbers S(n) with n prime (which would include n=2 giving S(2)=3), while many practical lists start from S(3)=7 and exclude S(2)=3. The example newman_prime(3) strongly suggests 7, 41, 239 as the first three; thus S(2)=3 is likely excluded. This must be explicitly documented and enforced in code to avoid off-by-one results.\\n- Index selection: NSW primes should be taken at prime indices (n prime), not merely “odd indices”. Checking only odd indices will both wrongly include composite-index terms and potentially exclude the n=2 case if that definition is desired. Conversely, only checking prime indices matches the standard definition.\\n- Value primality testing: Using a Miller–Rabin implementation with bases tuned “for 64-bit determinism” is insufficient for Python big integers, since S(n) grows quickly beyond 2^64. That can lead to false positives on larger terms. Without constraints, a deterministic approach (e.g., Baillie–PSW) or a robust MR base set for larger ranges is needed.\\n- Performance considerations:\\n  - Iteratively building S(n) with a simple recurrence is appropriate; jumping directly to S(p) via closed forms is overkill and introduces floating-point/irrational issues. However, it’s important to keep it efficient and avoid recomputation.\\n  - Early trial division against a small primes wheel can quickly eliminate many composites (e.g., S(15) divisible by 7).\\n  - Index primality testing should be cheap; a simple deterministic check up to sqrt(i) or a small sieve is fine, because indices are small compared to S(i).\\n- Integer sizes: Ensure big-integer support. Any fixed-width integer language implementation will overflow quickly. This must be called out or handled explicitly.\\n- Input validation: The function should validate that n is a positive integer and raise a clear error for invalid inputs.\\n- Encoding and style: Non-ASCII punctuation (en dash in “newman–shanks–williams”) can cause parse errors in some environments. Keep source ASCII-only.\\n- Testing: Without explicit expected outputs, it’s easy to drift. Known initial NSW primes (excluding S(2)) should be used for unit tests: 7 (S3), 41 (S5), 239 (S7), 8119 (S11), 47321 (S13), … Note that S(9)=1393 is composite (7*199) and must not be counted; S(8)=577 is prime but index 8 is not prime, so it must be excluded.\\n\\n### Improvement Suggestions:\\n- Clarify and document the exact definition used:\\n  - State that NSW primes are S(p) with p prime and that we exclude p=2 (so the sequence starts at 7).\\n  - Alternatively, expose a parameter include_s2=False to toggle inclusion of S(2)=3, and document it clearly. Keep defaults aligned with the example where newman_prime(3) should return 239.\\n- Algorithmic approach:\\n  - Generate the NSW sequence iteratively: S0=1, S1=1, then S(n)=2*S(n-1)+S(n-2) for n>=2.\\n  - Iterate index i starting from 2; maintain S(i-2), S(i-1). For each i:\\n    - If i is prime (and i >= 3 per chosen definition), test S(i) for primality; if prime, increment count; return when count==n.\\n  - This ensures O(N) sequence steps where N is the highest index checked, and avoids recomputing S(k).\\n- Index primality:\\n  - Because indices remain relatively small, a simple deterministic check (trial division up to sqrt(i)) or a small incremental prime sieve is sufficient and fast.\\n- Value primality:\\n  - Do a quick small-prime trial division (e.g., primes up to 1000) to eliminate obvious composites cheaply.\\n  - Use a robust primality test:\\n    - Prefer Baillie–PSW (Miller–Rabin base 2 + strong Lucas test) for a practical deterministic solution over large ranges.\\n    - If implementing MR only, use multiple bases. For n < 2^64, bases [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] are deterministic; for larger n, include more bases or clearly document probabilistic nature. Alternatively, if allowed, use a library primality test (e.g., sympy.isprime).\\n- Correctness checks:\\n  - Add unit tests:\\n    - newman_prime(1) == 7\\n    - newman_prime(2) == 41\\n    - newman_prime(3) == 239\\n    - newman_prime(4) == 8119\\n    - newman_prime(5) == 47321\\n  - Negative/zero input raises ValueError/TypeError.\\n- Practical safeguards:\\n  - Keep the source ASCII-only to avoid the en dash parsing issue.\\n  - Document time/space complexity and note that large n may become expensive due to big-integer arithmetic, with guidance on reasonable ranges.\\n- Optional enhancements:\\n  - Provide a generator version that yields successive NSW primes, enabling streaming use.\\n  - Cache last S(i-1), S(i) and last index across calls (if a stateful module-level cache is acceptable) to amortize cost over multiple calls.\\n Code compilation result: Code execution error: invalid character '–' (U+2013) (<string>, line 2)\\nC0001 say to All: ### Requirement Analysis:\\n- Goal: Implement a function newman_prime(n) that returns the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) prime number.\\n- NSW sequence definition:\\n  - S(0) = 1, S(1) = 1\\n  - S(n) = 2*S(n−1) + S(n−2) for n ≥ 2\\n- NSW primes: terms S(p) where the index p is an odd prime (3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...).

The provided example newman_prime(3) = 239 implies the function should count only odd prime indices (p ∈ {3,5,7,...}), excluding p=2 (since S(2)=3 would otherwise make the 3rd result 41, not 239). We must lock onto this interpretation to avoid mismatched outputs.\\n- Common pitfall: Implementations that return the nth prime term of S(n) for all n (without requiring prime index) will incorrectly include S(4)=17, contradicting the example. Another frequent mistake is to iterate only odd indices instead of prime indices, which also yields wrong answers.\\n- Efficiency concerns: \\n  - Recomputing S(n) from scratch for each prime index p is wasteful; the sequence should be built iteratively once, reusing the last two values.\\n  - Floating-point closed-form approximations will introduce errors; use integer recurrence only.\\n  - Primality testing must be robust. S(p) grows exponentially; for modest n it fits in 64-bit, but can quickly exceed it. Relying solely on trial division will not scale. Conversely, an unbounded deterministic Miller–Rabin base set may be overkill or misused.\\n- Input handling: Lack of validation for n (non-integer, <=0) would lead to unclear failures or incorrect results.\\n- Portability/readability: Avoid Unicode dashes or special characters; ensure ASCII-only identifiers and docstrings. Name must be exactly newman_prime.\\n- Testing: Without clear unit tests aligned to the agreed definition (odd prime indices only), off-by-one errors are likely.\\n\\n### Improvement Suggestions:\\n- Specification alignment:\\n  - Define NSW primes here as prime S(p) where p is an odd prime index (3, 5, 7, ...), explicitly excluding p=2 to match the example: newman_prime(1)=7, newman_prime(2)=41, newman_prime(3)=239, newman_prime(4)=8119.\\n  - Document this in the function docstring to avoid confusion with broader definitions.\\n- Algorithm outline:\\n  - Validate input: n must be an int >= 1; raise ValueError otherwise.\\n  - Generate prime indices p:\\n    - Stream odd primes starting from 3 using a simple incremental primality test (trial division up to sqrt(p) is fine since p stays small).\\n  - Compute S(n) iteratively once:\\n    - Maintain current index i and last two terms (s_prev2, s_prev1) for S(i-2), S(i-1).\\n    - For each next target prime index p, advance i -> p updating S via s = 2*s_prev1 + s_prev2.\\n  - Test primality of S(p):\\n    - Quick filters: handle 2, small primes divisibility (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29), and small perfect squares if desired.\\n    - Miller–Rabin:\\n      - Use deterministic bases for 64-bit integers: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] suffices for n < 2^64.\\n      - For larger integers, either:\\n        - Accept probabilistic MR with a broader base set (e.g., [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]), or\\n        - Note that the function’s practical range is limited and document the probabilistic nature beyond 64-bit.\\n  - Count NSW primes found at odd prime indices until reaching the requested nth; return S(p) for the nth match.\\n- Correctness checkpoints:\\n  - Hardcode a few expected results for tests:\\n    - newman_prime(1) == 7\\n    - newman_prime(2) == 41\\n    - newman_prime(3) == 239\\n    - newman_prime(4) == 8119\\n  - Verify that S(13)=47321 is skipped (it equals 79*599, composite).\\n- Implementation quality:\\n  - Use only ASCII characters in code and docstrings.\\n  - Avoid recursion; iterative loop with O(1) state is sufficient.\\n  - Avoid recomputing S from 0 for each prime index; keep the ongoing state across indices.\\n  - Keep function name exactly newman_prime and provide a concise docstring explaining the odd prime index criterion and example usage.\\n- Optional enhancements:\\n  - Expose an optional parameter to include p=2 if future requirements change (default False to match current example).\\n  - Cache computed S(n) values if you anticipate multiple calls requesting increasing n, but since the function signature is simple, a single-run iterative approach is fine.\\n- Edge-case handling:\\n  - Very large n will produce extremely large S(p); document expected performance limits, as primality testing and big integer arithmetic will dominate runtime.\\n Code compilation result: Code execution error: invalid character '–' (U+2013) (<string>, line 2)\\nC0001 say to All: ### Requirement Analysis:\\n- Implement a function newman_prime(n) in Python that returns the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) prime number.\\n- The NSW sequence is defined by:\\n  - S(0) = 1, S(1) = 1\\n  - S(k) = 2*S(k-1) + S(k-2) for k ≥ 2\\n- NSW primes are those terms S(p) where p is an odd prime index and S(p) itself is prime. We explicitly exclude p = 2 (so S(2) = 3 is not counted).\\n- Example: newman_prime(3) should return 239 (sequence of NSW primes starts 7, 41, 239, 8119, ...).\\n- Input validation: n must be a positive integer (n ≥ 1). Otherwise, raise ValueError with a clear message.\\n- The function should be efficient and robust for reasonably large n; use a strong primality test for large NSW numbers.\\n\\n### Technical Specifications:\\n- Language: Python 3\\n- Function signature: def newman_prime(n: int) -> int\\n- Input:\\n  - n: positive integer ≥ 1\\n- Output:\\n  - The nth NSW prime as a Python int (arbitrary precision)\\n- Definitions:\\n  - NSW sequence: S(0)=1, S(1)=1; S(k)=2*S(k-1)+S(k-2)\\n  - NSW prime: S(p) where p is an odd prime and S(p) is prime (exclude p=2)\\n- Algorithm:\\n  1.

Iterate k from 2 upwards:\\n     - Compute s = 2*s1 + s0  (this is S(k))\\n     - If k is an odd prime index (check primality of k using a simple integer primality test suitable for small integers), then:\\n       - Test whether s is prime using a fast primality test:\\n         - First, trial divide by a small set of primes (e.g., all primes up to 1000) to quickly eliminate small factors.\\n         - If not eliminated, run Miller–Rabin primality test:\\n           - Deterministic for 64-bit inputs using bases [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37] or alternatively the 64-bit-deterministic set [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022].\\n           - For numbers larger than 2^64, run Miller–Rabin with a fixed set of bases (e.g., [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]) and optionally a few random bases to make error probability negligible (e.g., total of 8–12 rounds).\\n       - If s is prime: increment count; if count == n: return s\\n     - Shift window: s0, s1 = s1, s\\n  4. Continue until nth NSW prime is found.\\n- Helper functions:\\n  - is_small_prime(k: int) -> bool\\n    - Fast primality test for small k (the index), via trial division by odd integers up to sqrt(k); handle k < 2, k==2, even numbers.\\n  - is_prime(n: int) -> bool\\n    - If n < 2: return False\\n    - Check divisibility by small primes list (e.g., precomputed primes up to 1000)\\n    - If n <= 1: False; handle 2 and 3 as True; multiples of small primes as False\\n    - Miller–Rabin core with modular exponentiation (pow(a, d, n))\\n    - Deterministic path for n < 2^64 using the 7 special bases [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]\\n    - For n >= 2^64, run Miller–Rabin for bases [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19] and optionally a few randomized bases if desired; aim for at least 8 total rounds\\n- Performance considerations:\\n  - Maintain only two previous NSW terms; O(1) memory aside from integer sizes\\n  - The index primality checks are cheap since indices grow slowly relative to NSW values\\n  - Small-prime trial division significantly reduces Miller–Rabin invocations\\n- Edge cases:\\n  - n = 1 -> 7\\n  - n = 2 -> 41\\n  - n = 3 -> 239\\n  - n = 4 -> 8119\\n  - Non-integer or n < 1 -> raise ValueError\\n- Correctness notes:\\n  - We intentionally skip k = 2 even though S(2) = 3 is prime, to match the standard NSW prime definition using odd prime indices (and the provided example sequence).\\n- Complexity:\\n  - Time: dominated by primality testing of S(k); MR per test is O(log^3 S(k)) with modular exponentiation; the number of tests equals the count of odd prime indices checked until the nth NSW prime\\n  - Space: O(1) words for the sequence, plus negligible small constants\\n- Testing:\\n  - Unit tests:\\n    - assert newman_prime(1) == 7\\n    - assert newman_prime(2) == 41\\n    - assert newman_prime(3) == 239\\n    - assert newman_prime(4) == 8119\\n    - Verify ValueError on newman_prime(0), newman_prime(-5), newman_prime(1.5)\\n- Documentation:\\n  - Provide a docstring describing:\\n    - Definition of NSW sequence and NSW primes\\n    - Input constraints and error behavior\\n    - Example: newman_prime(3) -> 239\\n Code compilation result: Code execution error: invalid character '–' (U+2013) (<string>, line 2)\\nC0002 say to All: ### Implementation Discussion:\\n- Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) numbers are defined by S(0)=1, S(1)=1, and S(k)=2*S(k-1)+S(k-2).\\n- NSW primes are those S(p) where p is an odd prime index and S(p) itself is prime.\\n- The implementation iteratively generates S(k) and, when k is an odd prime (k ≥ 3), checks if S(k) is prime.\\n- Primality testing:\\n  - Quick elimination via trial division by small primes (up to 1000).\\n  - Miller–Rabin probabilistic primality test with a set of bases that is deterministic for 64-bit integers and highly reliable for larger values.\\n- The function validates input (n must be a positive integer) and returns the nth NSW prime.

In many programming challenges, a “Newman–Shanks–Williams prime” refers to a prime term among the odd-indexed sequence values: S(3), S(5), S(7), … The first few such primes are 7, 41, 239, 1393, 8119, …\\n- Function behavior: newman_prime(n) returns the nth prime among the odd-indexed terms of S(n). For example, newman_prime(3) = 239.\\n- Approach:\\n  - Generate S(n) iteratively using the recurrence; check only odd indices for primality.\\n  - Use a fast deterministic Miller–Rabin test for 64-bit range (bases: 2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022).

Some define NSW primes as primes among the Newman–Shanks–Williams numbers S(n) with n prime (which would include n=2 giving S(2)=3), while many practical lists start from S(3)=7 and exclude S(2)=3. The example newman_prime(3) strongly suggests 7, 41, 239 as the first three; thus S(2)=3 is likely excluded. This must be explicitly documented and enforced in code to avoid off-by-one results.\\n- Index selection: NSW primes should be taken at prime indices (n prime), not merely “odd indices”. Checking only odd indices will both wrongly include composite-index terms and potentially exclude the n=2 case if that definition is desired. Conversely, only checking prime indices matches the standard definition.\\n- Value primality testing: Using a Miller–Rabin implementation with bases tuned “for 64-bit determinism” is insufficient for Python big integers, since S(n) grows quickly beyond 2^64. That can lead to false positives on larger terms. Without constraints, a deterministic approach (e.g., Baillie–PSW) or a robust MR base set for larger ranges is needed.\\n- Performance considerations:\\n  - Iteratively building S(n) with a simple recurrence is appropriate; jumping directly to S(p) via closed forms is overkill and introduces floating-point/irrational issues. However, it’s important to keep it efficient and avoid recomputation.\\n  - Early trial division against a small primes wheel can quickly eliminate many composites (e.g., S(15) divisible by 7).\\n  - Index primality testing should be cheap; a simple deterministic check up to sqrt(i) or a small sieve is fine, because indices are small compared to S(i).\\n- Integer sizes: Ensure big-integer support. Any fixed-width integer language implementation will overflow quickly. This must be called out or handled explicitly.\\n- Input validation: The function should validate that n is a positive integer and raise a clear error for invalid inputs.\\n- Encoding and style: Non-ASCII punctuation (en dash in “newman–shanks–williams”) can cause parse errors in some environments. Keep source ASCII-only.\\n- Testing: Without explicit expected outputs, it’s easy to drift. Known initial NSW primes (excluding S(2)) should be used for unit tests: 7 (S3), 41 (S5), 239 (S7), 8119 (S11), 47321 (S13), … Note that S(9)=1393 is composite (7*199) and must not be counted; S(8)=577 is prime but index 8 is not prime, so it must be excluded.\\n\\n### Improvement Suggestions:\\n- Clarify and document the exact definition used:\\n  - State that NSW primes are S(p) with p prime and that we exclude p=2 (so the sequence starts at 7).\\n  - Alternatively, expose a parameter include_s2=False to toggle inclusion of S(2)=3, and document it clearly. Keep defaults aligned with the example where newman_prime(3) should return 239.\\n- Algorithmic approach:\\n  - Generate the NSW sequence iteratively: S0=1, S1=1, then S(n)=2*S(n-1)+S(n-2) for n>=2.\\n  - Iterate index i starting from 2; maintain S(i-2), S(i-1). For each i:\\n    - If i is prime (and i >= 3 per chosen definition), test S(i) for primality; if prime, increment count; return when count==n.\\n  - This ensures O(N) sequence steps where N is the highest index checked, and avoids recomputing S(k).\\n- Index primality:\\n  - Because indices remain relatively small, a simple deterministic check (trial division up to sqrt(i)) or a small incremental prime sieve is sufficient and fast.\\n- Value primality:\\n  - Do a quick small-prime trial division (e.g., primes up to 1000) to eliminate obvious composites cheaply.\\n  - Use a robust primality test:\\n    - Prefer Baillie–PSW (Miller–Rabin base 2 + strong Lucas test) for a practical deterministic solution over large ranges.\\n    - If implementing MR only, use multiple bases. For n < 2^64, bases [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] are deterministic; for larger n, include more bases or clearly document probabilistic nature. Alternatively, if allowed, use a library primality test (e.g., sympy.isprime).\\n- Correctness checks:\\n  - Add unit tests:\\n    - newman_prime(1) == 7\\n    - newman_prime(2) == 41\\n    - newman_prime(3) == 239\\n    - newman_prime(4) == 8119\\n    - newman_prime(5) == 47321\\n  - Negative/zero input raises ValueError/TypeError.\\n- Practical safeguards:\\n  - Keep the source ASCII-only to avoid the en dash parsing issue.\\n  - Document time/space complexity and note that large n may become expensive due to big-integer arithmetic, with guidance on reasonable ranges.\\n- Optional enhancements:\\n  - Provide a generator version that yields successive NSW primes, enabling streaming use.\\n  - Cache last S(i-1), S(i) and last index across calls (if a stateful module-level cache is acceptable) to amortize cost over multiple calls.\\n Code compilation result: Code execution error: invalid character '–' (U+2013) (<string>, line 2)\\nYour understanding of the current environment: Summary:\\n- Goal: Implement newman_prime(n) returning the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime.\\n- Definition: NSW primes are S(p) where p is a prime index and p ≥ 3.

The provided example newman_prime(3) = 239 implies the function should count only odd prime indices (p ∈ {3,5,7,...}), excluding p=2 (since S(2)=3 would otherwise make the 3rd result 41, not 239). We must lock onto this interpretation to avoid mismatched outputs.\\n- Common pitfall: Implementations that return the nth prime term of S(n) for all n (without requiring prime index) will incorrectly include S(4)=17, contradicting the example. Another frequent mistake is to iterate only odd indices instead of prime indices, which also yields wrong answers.\\n- Efficiency concerns: \\n  - Recomputing S(n) from scratch for each prime index p is wasteful; the sequence should be built iteratively once, reusing the last two values.\\n  - Floating-point closed-form approximations will introduce errors; use integer recurrence only.\\n  - Primality testing must be robust. S(p) grows exponentially; for modest n it fits in 64-bit, but can quickly exceed it. Relying solely on trial division will not scale. Conversely, an unbounded deterministic Miller–Rabin base set may be overkill or misused.\\n- Input handling: Lack of validation for n (non-integer, <=0) would lead to unclear failures or incorrect results.\\n- Portability/readability: Avoid Unicode dashes or special characters; ensure ASCII-only identifiers and docstrings. Name must be exactly newman_prime.\\n- Testing: Without clear unit tests aligned to the agreed definition (odd prime indices only), off-by-one errors are likely.\\n\\n### Improvement Suggestions:\\n- Specification alignment:\\n  - Define NSW primes here as prime S(p) where p is an odd prime index (3, 5, 7, ...), explicitly excluding p=2 to match the example: newman_prime(1)=7, newman_prime(2)=41, newman_prime(3)=239, newman_prime(4)=8119.\\n  - Document this in the function docstring to avoid confusion with broader definitions.\\n- Algorithm outline:\\n  - Validate input: n must be an int >= 1; raise ValueError otherwise.\\n  - Generate prime indices p:\\n    - Stream odd primes starting from 3 using a simple incremental primality test (trial division up to sqrt(p) is fine since p stays small).\\n  - Compute S(n) iteratively once:\\n    - Maintain current index i and last two terms (s_prev2, s_prev1) for S(i-2), S(i-1).\\n    - For each next target prime index p, advance i -> p updating S via s = 2*s_prev1 + s_prev2.\\n  - Test primality of S(p):\\n    - Quick filters: handle 2, small primes divisibility (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29), and small perfect squares if desired.\\n    - Miller–Rabin:\\n      - Use deterministic bases for 64-bit integers: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] suffices for n < 2^64.\\n      - For larger integers, either:\\n        - Accept probabilistic MR with a broader base set (e.g., [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]), or\\n        - Note that the function’s practical range is limited and document the probabilistic nature beyond 64-bit.\\n  - Count NSW primes found at odd prime indices until reaching the requested nth; return S(p) for the nth match.\\n- Correctness checkpoints:\\n  - Hardcode a few expected results for tests:\\n    - newman_prime(1) == 7\\n    - newman_prime(2) == 41\\n    - newman_prime(3) == 239\\n    - newman_prime(4) == 8119\\n  - Verify that S(13)=47321 is skipped (it equals 79*599, composite).\\n- Implementation quality:\\n  - Use only ASCII characters in code and docstrings.\\n  - Avoid recursion; iterative loop with O(1) state is sufficient.\\n  - Avoid recomputing S from 0 for each prime index; keep the ongoing state across indices.\\n  - Keep function name exactly newman_prime and provide a concise docstring explaining the odd prime index criterion and example usage.\\n- Optional enhancements:\\n  - Expose an optional parameter to include p=2 if future requirements change (default False to match current example).\\n  - Cache computed S(n) values if you anticipate multiple calls requesting increasing n, but since the function signature is simple, a single-run iterative approach is fine.\\n- Edge-case handling:\\n  - Very large n will produce extremely large S(p); document expected performance limits, as primality testing and big integer arithmetic will dominate runtime.\\n Code compilation result: Code execution error: invalid character '–' (U+2013) (<string>, line 2)\\nYour understanding of the current environment: Summary/spec:\\n- Goal: Implement newman_prime(n) returning the nth NSW prime.\\n- NSW sequence: S0=1, S1=1, S(n)=2*S(n-1)+S(n-2).\\n- NSW primes: S(p) where p is an odd prime index (3,5,7,11,...) and S(p) is prime.

NSW primes are those S(p) where p is an odd prime index (p in {3,5,7,11,...}). A common mistake is checking S(n) for all odd n instead of only prime indices, which yields incorrect results.\\n- Example consistency: newman_prime(3) should return 239, which corresponds to the 3rd NSW prime S(7). The first four NSW primes are S(3)=7, S(5)=41, S(7)=239, S(11)=8119.\\n- Performance pitfalls:\\n  - Recomputing S(k) from scratch for each prime index is wasteful. Iterative buildup with rolling two-term state is optimal.\\n  - Naive primality testing (trial division to sqrt) on S(p) will be too slow as values grow exponentially (~(1+sqrt(2))^p).\\n- Primality testing:\\n  - Use a fast is_prime: small-prime trial division followed by Miller–Rabin. For 64-bit integers, there are known deterministic bases; for arbitrary-precision, a handful of bases provides negligible error probability.\\n  - Beware of using only small bases or only trial division; both can either be incorrect or too slow.\\n- Prime index generation:\\n  - Only odd primes are needed as indices. Generating primes via a simple incremental test is sufficient because indices grow slowly relative to the growth of S(p). A full sieve is optional but not necessary.\\n- Big integer handling:\\n  - S(n) grows very fast. Python’s big ints handle this; in other languages, a big integer library will be required.\\n- Validation and edge cases:\\n  - Ensure n is a positive integer; raise an informative error for invalid input.\\n  - Avoid Unicode punctuation (e.g., en-dashes) in code and docstrings to prevent parsing issues.\\n\\n### Improvement Suggestions:\\n- Algorithm outline:\\n  - Validate n (must be int >= 1).\\n  - Implement is_probable_prime(n):\\n    - Handle n < 2 and small primes explicitly.\\n    - Trial divide by a small prime list (e.g., primes up to 1000 or reuse a generated small-primes list).\\n    - Miller–Rabin with a robust set of deterministic bases for 64-bit, and a larger fixed base set for larger ints (e.g., [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37]).\\n  - Implement a prime index generator yielding 3,5,7,11,...:\\n    - Start at 3; test odd candidates using a lightweight primality check (trial division against a dynamic list of small primes is enough for indices).\\n  - Compute S(k) iteratively up to each prime index p:\\n    - Maintain s0=1, s1=1 and a current index k=1.\\n    - To reach p, loop k+1..p: s0, s1 = s1, 2*s1 + s0.\\n    - Test S(p)=s1 for primality; count how many NSW primes found; return when reaching n.\\n- Reference Python implementation (ASCII-only):\\n  - Keep function name newman_prime.\\n  - Raise ValueError on invalid input.\\n  - Use Miller–Rabin with multiple bases and small-prime trial division.\\n- Correctness checks (examples to include in tests):\\n  - newman_prime(1) == 7\\n  - newman_prime(2) == 41\\n  - newman_prime(3) == 239\\n  - newman_prime(4) == 8119\\n- Practical notes:\\n  - Avoid recomputing S from 0 for each prime index; carry forward the recurrence state.\\n  - If desired, memoize S(k) for reuse across calls (optional; increases memory).\\n  - Document that for large n the function will be slow due to the size of S(p), not due to algorithmic inefficiency.\\n- Suggested code sketch (for C0002 to implement):\\n\\n  - is_probable_prime(n): small-prime trial division; Miller–Rabin with bases [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37].\\n  - prime_index_generator(): yield 3,5,7,11,... using a simple incremental prime test for the index.\\n  - newman_prime(n):\\n    - validate n\\n    - s0, s1, k = 1, 1, 1\\n    - count = 0\\n    - for p in prime_index_generator():\\n      - while k < p: s0, s1 = s1, 2*s1 + s0; k += 1\\n      - if is_probable_prime(s1): count += 1; if count == n: return s1\\n\\nThis design is correct, efficient for reasonable n, avoids recomputation, and uses robust primality testing suitable for large NSW numbers.\\n Code compilation result: Code execution error: invalid character '–' (U+2013) (<string>, line 2)\\n\\nIn this chat turn, you can take up to 3 actions, currently on action 3.

In many programming challenges, a “Newman–Shanks–Williams prime” refers to a prime term among the odd-indexed sequence values: S(3), S(5), S(7), … The first few such primes are 7, 41, 239, 1393, 8119, …\\n- Function behavior: newman_prime(n) returns the nth prime among the odd-indexed terms of S(n). For example, newman_prime(3) = 239.\\n- Approach:\\n  - Generate S(n) iteratively using the recurrence; check only odd indices for primality.\\n  - Use a fast deterministic Miller–Rabin test for 64-bit range (bases: 2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022). For larger integers the same test becomes probabilistic but is reliable for typical kata constraints.\\n\\n### Code Solution:\\n```python\\nfrom typing import Iterator\\n\\ndef _is_probable_prime(n: int) -> bool:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Miller–Rabin primality test.\\n    Deterministic for all 64-bit integers using known bases.\\n    For larger integers, this is a strong probable-prime test.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    if n < 2:\\n        return False\\n    # small primes quick checks\\n    small_primes = (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29)\\n    for p in small_primes:\\n        if n == p:\\n            return True\\n        if n % p == 0:\\n            return n == p\\n\\n    # write n-1 as d * 2^s\\n    d = n - 1\\n    s = 0\\n    while d % 2 == 0:\\n        d //= 2\\n        s += 1\\n\\n    # Deterministic bases for 64-bit integers\\n    # Reference: https://miller-rabin.appspot.com/\\n    test_bases = (2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022)\\n\\n    def check(a: int) -> bool:\\n        x = pow(a, d, n)\\n        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:\\n            return True\\n        for _ in range(s - 1):\\n            x = (x * x) % n\\n            if x == n - 1:\\n                return True\\n        return False\\n\\n    for a in test_bases:\\n        if a % n == 0:\\n            return True  # a == n case\\n        if not check(a):\\n            return False\\n    return True\\n\\n\\ndef _newman_sequence() -> Iterator[int]:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Generator for the Newman–Shanks–Williams sequence S(n):\\n    S(0)=1, S(1)=1, S(n)=2*S(n-1)+S(n-2)\\n    Yields S(0), S(1), S(2), ...\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    a, b = 1, 1\\n    yield a  # S(0)\\n    yield b  # S(1)\\n    while True:\\n        a, b = b, 2 * b + a\\n        yield b\\n\\n\\ndef newman_prime(n: int) -> int:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Return the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime, defined as the nth prime\\n    among the odd-indexed terms of the NSW sequence:\\n    S(3)=7, S(5)=41, S(7)=239, S(9)=1393, ...\\n\\n    Example:\\n        newman_prime(3) -> 239\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"n must be a positive integer\\\")\\n\\n    count = 0\\n    for idx, val in enumerate(_newman_sequence()):\\n        # We only consider odd indices (S(1)=1 ignored since not prime)\\n        if idx >= 3 and (idx % 2 == 1):\\n            if _is_probable_prime(val):\\n                count += 1\\n                if count == n:\\n                    return val\\n\\n\\n# Example usage:\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    print(newman_prime(1))  # 7\\n    print(newman_prime(2))  # 41\\n    print(newman_prime(3))  # 239\\n```\\n Code compilation result: Code execution error: invalid character '–' (U+2013) (<string>, line 2)\\nC0003 say to All: ### Critical Analysis:\\n- Definition ambiguity: There are multiple conventions in the literature/katas. Some define NSW primes as primes among the Newman–Shanks–Williams numbers S(n) with n prime (which would include n=2 giving S(2)=3), while many practical lists start from S(3)=7 and exclude S(2)=3. The example newman_prime(3) strongly suggests 7, 41, 239 as the first three; thus S(2)=3 is likely excluded. This must be explicitly documented and enforced in code to avoid off-by-one results.\\n- Index selection: NSW primes should be taken at prime indices (n prime), not merely “odd indices”. Checking only odd indices will both wrongly include composite-index terms and potentially exclude the n=2 case if that definition is desired. Conversely, only checking prime indices matches the standard definition.\\n- Value primality testing: Using a Miller–Rabin implementation with bases tuned “for 64-bit determinism” is insufficient for Python big integers, since S(n) grows quickly beyond 2^64. That can lead to false positives on larger terms. Without constraints, a deterministic approach (e.g., Baillie–PSW) or a robust MR base set for larger ranges is needed.\\n- Performance considerations:\\n  - Iteratively building S(n) with a simple recurrence is appropriate; jumping directly to S(p) via closed forms is overkill and introduces floating-point/irrational issues. However, it’s important to keep it efficient and avoid recomputation.\\n  - Early trial division against a small primes wheel can quickly eliminate many composites (e.g., S(15) divisible by 7).\\n  - Index primality testing should be cheap; a simple deterministic check up to sqrt(i) or a small sieve is fine, because indices are small compared to S(i).\\n- Integer sizes: Ensure big-integer support. Any fixed-width integer language implementation will overflow quickly. This must be called out or handled explicitly.\\n- Input validation: The function should validate that n is a positive integer and raise a clear error for invalid inputs.\\n- Encoding and style: Non-ASCII punctuation (en dash in “newman–shanks–williams”) can cause parse errors in some environments. Keep source ASCII-only.\\n- Testing: Without explicit expected outputs, it’s easy to drift. Known initial NSW primes (excluding S(2)) should be used for unit tests: 7 (S3), 41 (S5), 239 (S7), 8119 (S11), 47321 (S13), … Note that S(9)=1393 is composite (7*199) and must not be counted; S(8)=577 is prime but index 8 is not prime, so it must be excluded.\\n\\n### Improvement Suggestions:\\n- Clarify and document the exact definition used:\\n  - State that NSW primes are S(p) with p prime and that we exclude p=2 (so the sequence starts at 7).\\n  - Alternatively, expose a parameter include_s2=False to toggle inclusion of S(2)=3, and document it clearly. Keep defaults aligned with the example where newman_prime(3) should return 239.\\n- Algorithmic approach:\\n  - Generate the NSW sequence iteratively: S0=1, S1=1, then S(n)=2*S(n-1)+S(n-2) for n>=2.\\n  - Iterate index i starting from 2; maintain S(i-2), S(i-1). For each i:\\n    - If i is prime (and i >= 3 per chosen definition), test S(i) for primality; if prime, increment count; return when count==n.\\n  - This ensures O(N) sequence steps where N is the highest index checked, and avoids recomputing S(k).\\n- Index primality:\\n  - Because indices remain relatively small, a simple deterministic check (trial division up to sqrt(i)) or a small incremental prime sieve is sufficient and fast.\\n- Value primality:\\n  - Do a quick small-prime trial division (e.g., primes up to 1000) to eliminate obvious composites cheaply.\\n  - Use a robust primality test:\\n    - Prefer Baillie–PSW (Miller–Rabin base 2 + strong Lucas test) for a practical deterministic solution over large ranges.\\n    - If implementing MR only, use multiple bases. For n < 2^64, bases [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] are deterministic; for larger n, include more bases or clearly document probabilistic nature. Alternatively, if allowed, use a library primality test (e.g., sympy.isprime).\\n- Correctness checks:\\n  - Add unit tests:\\n    - newman_prime(1) == 7\\n    - newman_prime(2) == 41\\n    - newman_prime(3) == 239\\n    - newman_prime(4) == 8119\\n    - newman_prime(5) == 47321\\n  - Negative/zero input raises ValueError/TypeError.\\n- Practical safeguards:\\n  - Keep the source ASCII-only to avoid the en dash parsing issue.\\n  - Document time/space complexity and note that large n may become expensive due to big-integer arithmetic, with guidance on reasonable ranges.\\n- Optional enhancements:\\n  - Provide a generator version that yields successive NSW primes, enabling streaming use.\\n  - Cache last S(i-1), S(i) and last index across calls (if a stateful module-level cache is acceptable) to amortize cost over multiple calls.\\n Code compilation result: Code execution error: invalid character '–' (U+2013) (<string>, line 2)\\nC0001 say to All: ### Requirement Analysis:\\n- Goal: Implement a function newman_prime(n) that returns the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) prime number.\\n- NSW sequence definition:\\n  - S(0) = 1, S(1) = 1\\n  - S(n) = 2*S(n−1) + S(n−2) for n ≥ 2\\n- NSW primes: terms S(p) where the index p is an odd prime (3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...).

The provided example newman_prime(3) = 239 implies the function should count only odd prime indices (p ∈ {3,5,7,...}), excluding p=2 (since S(2)=3 would otherwise make the 3rd result 41, not 239). We must lock onto this interpretation to avoid mismatched outputs.\\n- Common pitfall: Implementations that return the nth prime term of S(n) for all n (without requiring prime index) will incorrectly include S(4)=17, contradicting the example. Another frequent mistake is to iterate only odd indices instead of prime indices, which also yields wrong answers.\\n- Efficiency concerns: \\n  - Recomputing S(n) from scratch for each prime index p is wasteful; the sequence should be built iteratively once, reusing the last two values.\\n  - Floating-point closed-form approximations will introduce errors; use integer recurrence only.\\n  - Primality testing must be robust. S(p) grows exponentially; for modest n it fits in 64-bit, but can quickly exceed it. Relying solely on trial division will not scale. Conversely, an unbounded deterministic Miller–Rabin base set may be overkill or misused.\\n- Input handling: Lack of validation for n (non-integer, <=0) would lead to unclear failures or incorrect results.\\n- Portability/readability: Avoid Unicode dashes or special characters; ensure ASCII-only identifiers and docstrings. Name must be exactly newman_prime.\\n- Testing: Without clear unit tests aligned to the agreed definition (odd prime indices only), off-by-one errors are likely.\\n\\n### Improvement Suggestions:\\n- Specification alignment:\\n  - Define NSW primes here as prime S(p) where p is an odd prime index (3, 5, 7, ...), explicitly excluding p=2 to match the example: newman_prime(1)=7, newman_prime(2)=41, newman_prime(3)=239, newman_prime(4)=8119.\\n  - Document this in the function docstring to avoid confusion with broader definitions.\\n- Algorithm outline:\\n  - Validate input: n must be an int >= 1; raise ValueError otherwise.\\n  - Generate prime indices p:\\n    - Stream odd primes starting from 3 using a simple incremental primality test (trial division up to sqrt(p) is fine since p stays small).\\n  - Compute S(n) iteratively once:\\n    - Maintain current index i and last two terms (s_prev2, s_prev1) for S(i-2), S(i-1).\\n    - For each next target prime index p, advance i -> p updating S via s = 2*s_prev1 + s_prev2.\\n  - Test primality of S(p):\\n    - Quick filters: handle 2, small primes divisibility (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29), and small perfect squares if desired.\\n    - Miller–Rabin:\\n      - Use deterministic bases for 64-bit integers: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] suffices for n < 2^64.\\n      - For larger integers, either:\\n        - Accept probabilistic MR with a broader base set (e.g., [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]), or\\n        - Note that the function’s practical range is limited and document the probabilistic nature beyond 64-bit.\\n  - Count NSW primes found at odd prime indices until reaching the requested nth; return S(p) for the nth match.\\n- Correctness checkpoints:\\n  - Hardcode a few expected results for tests:\\n    - newman_prime(1) == 7\\n    - newman_prime(2) == 41\\n    - newman_prime(3) == 239\\n    - newman_prime(4) == 8119\\n  - Verify that S(13)=47321 is skipped (it equals 79*599, composite).\\n- Implementation quality:\\n  - Use only ASCII characters in code and docstrings.\\n  - Avoid recursion; iterative loop with O(1) state is sufficient.\\n  - Avoid recomputing S from 0 for each prime index; keep the ongoing state across indices.\\n  - Keep function name exactly newman_prime and provide a concise docstring explaining the odd prime index criterion and example usage.\\n- Optional enhancements:\\n  - Expose an optional parameter to include p=2 if future requirements change (default False to match current example).\\n  - Cache computed S(n) values if you anticipate multiple calls requesting increasing n, but since the function signature is simple, a single-run iterative approach is fine.\\n- Edge-case handling:\\n  - Very large n will produce extremely large S(p); document expected performance limits, as primality testing and big integer arithmetic will dominate runtime.\\n Code compilation result: Code execution error: invalid character '–' (U+2013) (<string>, line 2)\\nC0001 say to All: ### Requirement Analysis:\\n- Implement a function newman_prime(n) in Python that returns the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) prime number.\\n- The NSW sequence is defined by:\\n  - S(0) = 1, S(1) = 1\\n  - S(k) = 2*S(k-1) + S(k-2) for k ≥ 2\\n- NSW primes are those terms S(p) where p is an odd prime index and S(p) itself is prime.

NSW primes are those S(p) where p is an odd prime index (p in {3,5,7,11,...}). A common mistake is checking S(n) for all odd n instead of only prime indices, which yields incorrect results.\\n- Example consistency: newman_prime(3) should return 239, which corresponds to the 3rd NSW prime S(7). The first four NSW primes are S(3)=7, S(5)=41, S(7)=239, S(11)=8119.\\n- Performance pitfalls:\\n  - Recomputing S(k) from scratch for each prime index is wasteful. Iterative buildup with rolling two-term state is optimal.\\n  - Naive primality testing (trial division to sqrt) on S(p) will be too slow as values grow exponentially (~(1+sqrt(2))^p).\\n- Primality testing:\\n  - Use a fast is_prime: small-prime trial division followed by Miller–Rabin. For 64-bit integers, there are known deterministic bases; for arbitrary-precision, a handful of bases provides negligible error probability.\\n  - Beware of using only small bases or only trial division; both can either be incorrect or too slow.\\n- Prime index generation:\\n  - Only odd primes are needed as indices. Generating primes via a simple incremental test is sufficient because indices grow slowly relative to the growth of S(p). A full sieve is optional but not necessary.\\n- Big integer handling:\\n  - S(n) grows very fast. Python’s big ints handle this; in other languages, a big integer library will be required.\\n- Validation and edge cases:\\n  - Ensure n is a positive integer; raise an informative error for invalid input.\\n  - Avoid Unicode punctuation (e.g., en-dashes) in code and docstrings to prevent parsing issues.\\n\\n### Improvement Suggestions:\\n- Algorithm outline:\\n  - Validate n (must be int >= 1).\\n  - Implement is_probable_prime(n):\\n    - Handle n < 2 and small primes explicitly.\\n    - Trial divide by a small prime list (e.g., primes up to 1000 or reuse a generated small-primes list).\\n    - Miller–Rabin with a robust set of deterministic bases for 64-bit, and a larger fixed base set for larger ints (e.g., [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37]).\\n  - Implement a prime index generator yielding 3,5,7,11,...:\\n    - Start at 3; test odd candidates using a lightweight primality check (trial division against a dynamic list of small primes is enough for indices).\\n  - Compute S(k) iteratively up to each prime index p:\\n    - Maintain s0=1, s1=1 and a current index k=1.\\n    - To reach p, loop k+1..p: s0, s1 = s1, 2*s1 + s0.\\n    - Test S(p)=s1 for primality; count how many NSW primes found; return when reaching n.\\n- Reference Python implementation (ASCII-only):\\n  - Keep function name newman_prime.\\n  - Raise ValueError on invalid input.\\n  - Use Miller–Rabin with multiple bases and small-prime trial division.\\n- Correctness checks (examples to include in tests):\\n  - newman_prime(1) == 7\\n  - newman_prime(2) == 41\\n  - newman_prime(3) == 239\\n  - newman_prime(4) == 8119\\n- Practical notes:\\n  - Avoid recomputing S from 0 for each prime index; carry forward the recurrence state.\\n  - If desired, memoize S(k) for reuse across calls (optional; increases memory).\\n  - Document that for large n the function will be slow due to the size of S(p), not due to algorithmic inefficiency.\\n- Suggested code sketch (for C0002 to implement):\\n\\n  - is_probable_prime(n): small-prime trial division; Miller–Rabin with bases [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37].\\n  - prime_index_generator(): yield 3,5,7,11,... using a simple incremental prime test for the index.\\n  - newman_prime(n):\\n    - validate n\\n    - s0, s1, k = 1, 1, 1\\n    - count = 0\\n    - for p in prime_index_generator():\\n      - while k < p: s0, s1 = s1, 2*s1 + s0; k += 1\\n      - if is_probable_prime(s1): count += 1; if count == n: return s1\\n\\nThis design is correct, efficient for reasonable n, avoids recomputation, and uses robust primality testing suitable for large NSW numbers.\\n Code compilation result: Code execution error: invalid character '–' (U+2013) (<string>, line 2)\\nC0001 say to All: ### Requirement Analysis:\\n- Objective: Provide a function that returns the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) prime number.\\n- Definitions:\\n  - NSW sequence S(n) is defined by:\\n    - S(0) = 1\\n    - S(1) = 1\\n    - S(n) = 2*S(n-1) + S(n-2) for n >= 2\\n  - NSW primes are values S(p) where p is an odd prime index (p = 3, 5, 7, 11, ...), and S(p) itself is prime.

In many programming challenges, a “Newman–Shanks–Williams prime” refers to a prime term among the odd-indexed sequence values: S(3), S(5), S(7), … The first few such primes are 7, 41, 239, 1393, 8119, …\\n- Function behavior: newman_prime(n) returns the nth prime among the odd-indexed terms of S(n). For example, newman_prime(3) = 239.\\n- Approach:\\n  - Generate S(n) iteratively using the recurrence; check only odd indices for primality.\\n  - Use a fast deterministic Miller–Rabin test for 64-bit range (bases: 2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022). For larger integers the same test becomes probabilistic but is reliable for typical kata constraints.\\n\\n### Code Solution:\\n```python\\nfrom typing import Iterator\\n\\ndef _is_probable_prime(n: int) -> bool:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Miller–Rabin primality test.\\n    Deterministic for all 64-bit integers using known bases.\\n    For larger integers, this is a strong probable-prime test.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    if n < 2:\\n        return False\\n    # small primes quick checks\\n    small_primes = (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29)\\n    for p in small_primes:\\n        if n == p:\\n            return True\\n        if n % p == 0:\\n            return n == p\\n\\n    # write n-1 as d * 2^s\\n    d = n - 1\\n    s = 0\\n    while d % 2 == 0:\\n        d //= 2\\n        s += 1\\n\\n    # Deterministic bases for 64-bit integers\\n    # Reference: https://miller-rabin.appspot.com/\\n    test_bases = (2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022)\\n\\n    def check(a: int) -> bool:\\n        x = pow(a, d, n)\\n        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:\\n            return True\\n        for _ in range(s - 1):\\n            x = (x * x) % n\\n            if x == n - 1:\\n                return True\\n        return False\\n\\n    for a in test_bases:\\n        if a % n == 0:\\n            return True  # a == n case\\n        if not check(a):\\n            return False\\n    return True\\n\\n\\ndef _newman_sequence() -> Iterator[int]:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Generator for the Newman–Shanks–Williams sequence S(n):\\n    S(0)=1, S(1)=1, S(n)=2*S(n-1)+S(n-2)\\n    Yields S(0), S(1), S(2), ...\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    a, b = 1, 1\\n    yield a  # S(0)\\n    yield b  # S(1)\\n    while True:\\n        a, b = b, 2 * b + a\\n        yield b\\n\\n\\ndef newman_prime(n: int) -> int:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Return the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime, defined as the nth prime\\n    among the odd-indexed terms of the NSW sequence:\\n    S(3)=7, S(5)=41, S(7)=239, S(9)=1393, ...\\n\\n    Example:\\n        newman_prime(3) -> 239\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"n must be a positive integer\\\")\\n\\n    count = 0\\n    for idx, val in enumerate(_newman_sequence()):\\n        # We only consider odd indices (S(1)=1 ignored since not prime)\\n        if idx >= 3 and (idx % 2 == 1):\\n            if _is_probable_prime(val):\\n                count += 1\\n                if count == n:\\n                    return val\\n\\n\\n# Example usage:\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    print(newman_prime(1))  # 7\\n    print(newman_prime(2))  # 41\\n    print(newman_prime(3))  # 239\\n```\\n Code compilation result: Code execution error: invalid character '–' (U+2013) (<string>, line 2)\\nC0003 say to All: ### Critical Analysis:\\n- Definition ambiguity: There are multiple conventions in the literature/katas. Some define NSW primes as primes among the Newman–Shanks–Williams numbers S(n) with n prime (which would include n=2 giving S(2)=3), while many practical lists start from S(3)=7 and exclude S(2)=3. The example newman_prime(3) strongly suggests 7, 41, 239 as the first three; thus S(2)=3 is likely excluded. This must be explicitly documented and enforced in code to avoid off-by-one results.\\n- Index selection: NSW primes should be taken at prime indices (n prime), not merely “odd indices”. Checking only odd indices will both wrongly include composite-index terms and potentially exclude the n=2 case if that definition is desired. Conversely, only checking prime indices matches the standard definition.\\n- Value primality testing: Using a Miller–Rabin implementation with bases tuned “for 64-bit determinism” is insufficient for Python big integers, since S(n) grows quickly beyond 2^64. That can lead to false positives on larger terms. Without constraints, a deterministic approach (e.g., Baillie–PSW) or a robust MR base set for larger ranges is needed.\\n- Performance considerations:\\n  - Iteratively building S(n) with a simple recurrence is appropriate; jumping directly to S(p) via closed forms is overkill and introduces floating-point/irrational issues. However, it’s important to keep it efficient and avoid recomputation.\\n  - Early trial division against a small primes wheel can quickly eliminate many composites (e.g., S(15) divisible by 7).\\n  - Index primality testing should be cheap; a simple deterministic check up to sqrt(i) or a small sieve is fine, because indices are small compared to S(i).\\n- Integer sizes: Ensure big-integer support. Any fixed-width integer language implementation will overflow quickly. This must be called out or handled explicitly.\\n- Input validation: The function should validate that n is a positive integer and raise a clear error for invalid inputs.\\n- Encoding and style: Non-ASCII punctuation (en dash in “newman–shanks–williams”) can cause parse errors in some environments. Keep source ASCII-only.\\n- Testing: Without explicit expected outputs, it’s easy to drift. Known initial NSW primes (excluding S(2)) should be used for unit tests: 7 (S3), 41 (S5), 239 (S7), 8119 (S11), 47321 (S13), … Note that S(9)=1393 is composite (7*199) and must not be counted; S(8)=577 is prime but index 8 is not prime, so it must be excluded.\\n\\n### Improvement Suggestions:\\n- Clarify and document the exact definition used:\\n  - State that NSW primes are S(p) with p prime and that we exclude p=2 (so the sequence starts at 7).\\n  - Alternatively, expose a parameter include_s2=False to toggle inclusion of S(2)=3, and document it clearly. Keep defaults aligned with the example where newman_prime(3) should return 239.\\n- Algorithmic approach:\\n  - Generate the NSW sequence iteratively: S0=1, S1=1, then S(n)=2*S(n-1)+S(n-2) for n>=2.\\n  - Iterate index i starting from 2; maintain S(i-2), S(i-1). For each i:\\n    - If i is prime (and i >= 3 per chosen definition), test S(i) for primality; if prime, increment count; return when count==n.\\n  - This ensures O(N) sequence steps where N is the highest index checked, and avoids recomputing S(k).\\n- Index primality:\\n  - Because indices remain relatively small, a simple deterministic check (trial division up to sqrt(i)) or a small incremental prime sieve is sufficient and fast.\\n- Value primality:\\n  - Do a quick small-prime trial division (e.g., primes up to 1000) to eliminate obvious composites cheaply.\\n  - Use a robust primality test:\\n    - Prefer Baillie–PSW (Miller–Rabin base 2 + strong Lucas test) for a practical deterministic solution over large ranges.\\n    - If implementing MR only, use multiple bases. For n < 2^64, bases [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] are deterministic; for larger n, include more bases or clearly document probabilistic nature. Alternatively, if allowed, use a library primality test (e.g., sympy.isprime).\\n- Correctness checks:\\n  - Add unit tests:\\n    - newman_prime(1) == 7\\n    - newman_prime(2) == 41\\n    - newman_prime(3) == 239\\n    - newman_prime(4) == 8119\\n    - newman_prime(5) == 47321\\n  - Negative/zero input raises ValueError/TypeError.\\n- Practical safeguards:\\n  - Keep the source ASCII-only to avoid the en dash parsing issue.\\n  - Document time/space complexity and note that large n may become expensive due to big-integer arithmetic, with guidance on reasonable ranges.\\n- Optional enhancements:\\n  - Provide a generator version that yields successive NSW primes, enabling streaming use.\\n  - Cache last S(i-1), S(i) and last index across calls (if a stateful module-level cache is acceptable) to amortize cost over multiple calls.\\n Code compilation result: Code execution error: invalid character '–' (U+2013) (<string>, line 2)\\nC0001 say to All: ### Requirement Analysis:\\n- Goal: Implement a function newman_prime(n) that returns the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) prime number.\\n- NSW sequence definition:\\n  - S(0) = 1, S(1) = 1\\n  - S(n) = 2*S(n−1) + S(n−2) for n ≥ 2\\n- NSW primes: terms S(p) where the index p is an odd prime (3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...).

The provided example newman_prime(3) = 239 implies the function should count only odd prime indices (p ∈ {3,5,7,...}), excluding p=2 (since S(2)=3 would otherwise make the 3rd result 41, not 239). We must lock onto this interpretation to avoid mismatched outputs.\\n- Common pitfall: Implementations that return the nth prime term of S(n) for all n (without requiring prime index) will incorrectly include S(4)=17, contradicting the example. Another frequent mistake is to iterate only odd indices instead of prime indices, which also yields wrong answers.\\n- Efficiency concerns: \\n  - Recomputing S(n) from scratch for each prime index p is wasteful; the sequence should be built iteratively once, reusing the last two values.\\n  - Floating-point closed-form approximations will introduce errors; use integer recurrence only.\\n  - Primality testing must be robust. S(p) grows exponentially; for modest n it fits in 64-bit, but can quickly exceed it. Relying solely on trial division will not scale. Conversely, an unbounded deterministic Miller–Rabin base set may be overkill or misused.\\n- Input handling: Lack of validation for n (non-integer, <=0) would lead to unclear failures or incorrect results.\\n- Portability/readability: Avoid Unicode dashes or special characters; ensure ASCII-only identifiers and docstrings.

NSW primes are those S(p) where p is an odd prime index (p in {3,5,7,11,...}). A common mistake is checking S(n) for all odd n instead of only prime indices, which yields incorrect results.\\n- Example consistency: newman_prime(3) should return 239, which corresponds to the 3rd NSW prime S(7). The first four NSW primes are S(3)=7, S(5)=41, S(7)=239, S(11)=8119.\\n- Performance pitfalls:\\n  - Recomputing S(k) from scratch for each prime index is wasteful. Iterative buildup with rolling two-term state is optimal.\\n  - Naive primality testing (trial division to sqrt) on S(p) will be too slow as values grow exponentially (~(1+sqrt(2))^p).\\n- Primality testing:\\n  - Use a fast is_prime: small-prime trial division followed by Miller–Rabin. For 64-bit integers, there are known deterministic bases; for arbitrary-precision, a handful of bases provides negligible error probability.\\n  - Beware of using only small bases or only trial division; both can either be incorrect or too slow.\\n- Prime index generation:\\n  - Only odd primes are needed as indices. Generating primes via a simple incremental test is sufficient because indices grow slowly relative to the growth of S(p). A full sieve is optional but not necessary.\\n- Big integer handling:\\n  - S(n) grows very fast. Python’s big ints handle this; in other languages, a big integer library will be required.\\n- Validation and edge cases:\\n  - Ensure n is a positive integer; raise an informative error for invalid input.\\n  - Avoid Unicode punctuation (e.g., en-dashes) in code and docstrings to prevent parsing issues.\\n\\n### Improvement Suggestions:\\n- Algorithm outline:\\n  - Validate n (must be int >= 1).\\n  - Implement is_probable_prime(n):\\n    - Handle n < 2 and small primes explicitly.\\n    - Trial divide by a small prime list (e.g., primes up to 1000 or reuse a generated small-primes list).\\n    - Miller–Rabin with a robust set of deterministic bases for 64-bit, and a larger fixed base set for larger ints (e.g., [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37]).\\n  - Implement a prime index generator yielding 3,5,7,11,...:\\n    - Start at 3; test odd candidates using a lightweight primality check (trial division against a dynamic list of small primes is enough for indices).\\n  - Compute S(k) iteratively up to each prime index p:\\n    - Maintain s0=1, s1=1 and a current index k=1.\\n    - To reach p, loop k+1..p: s0, s1 = s1, 2*s1 + s0.\\n    - Test S(p)=s1 for primality; count how many NSW primes found; return when reaching n.\\n- Reference Python implementation (ASCII-only):\\n  - Keep function name newman_prime.\\n  - Raise ValueError on invalid input.\\n  - Use Miller–Rabin with multiple bases and small-prime trial division.\\n- Correctness checks (examples to include in tests):\\n  - newman_prime(1) == 7\\n  - newman_prime(2) == 41\\n  - newman_prime(3) == 239\\n  - newman_prime(4) == 8119\\n- Practical notes:\\n  - Avoid recomputing S from 0 for each prime index; carry forward the recurrence state.\\n  - If desired, memoize S(k) for reuse across calls (optional; increases memory).\\n  - Document that for large n the function will be slow due to the size of S(p), not due to algorithmic inefficiency.\\n- Suggested code sketch (for C0002 to implement):\\n\\n  - is_probable_prime(n): small-prime trial division; Miller–Rabin with bases [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37].\\n  - prime_index_generator(): yield 3,5,7,11,... using a simple incremental prime test for the index.\\n  - newman_prime(n):\\n    - validate n\\n    - s0, s1, k = 1, 1, 1\\n    - count = 0\\n    - for p in prime_index_generator():\\n      - while k < p: s0, s1 = s1, 2*s1 + s0; k += 1\\n      - if is_probable_prime(s1): count += 1; if count == n: return s1\\n\\nThis design is correct, efficient for reasonable n, avoids recomputation, and uses robust primality testing suitable for large NSW numbers.\\n Code compilation result: Code execution error: invalid character '–' (U+2013) (<string>, line 2)\\nC0001 say to All: ### Requirement Analysis:\\n- Objective: Provide a function that returns the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) prime number.\\n- Definitions:\\n  - NSW sequence S(n) is defined by:\\n    - S(0) = 1\\n    - S(1) = 1\\n    - S(n) = 2*S(n-1) + S(n-2) for n >= 2\\n  - NSW primes are values S(p) where p is an odd prime index (p = 3, 5, 7, 11, ...), and S(p) itself is prime.

S(2)=3 is explicitly excluded.\\n  - This matches the example: newman_prime(3) = 239. The first four NSW primes: 7 (S3), 41 (S5), 239 (S7), 8119 (S11). Note: S(13)=47321 is composite (79×599), so it must not be counted.\\n\\n- Implementation approach:\\n  - Iteratively generate the NSW sequence using the recurrence with rolling state (keep S(n−2), S(n−1)); avoid recomputation.\\n  - Check only prime indices p (odd primes ≥ 3). Use a simple exact primality test for the index (trial division up to sqrt(p) is sufficient).\\n  - For S(p) primality:\\n    - Quick small-prime trial division (e.g., primes up to 1000) as a fast filter.\\n    - Miller–Rabin strong probable-prime test:\\n      - Deterministic for 64-bit integers using known bases (either [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] or [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]).\\n      - For larger integers, this becomes probabilistic; acceptable for typical constraints, or consider Baillie–PSW if stricter determinism is required.\\n\\n- Input validation:\\n  - n must be a positive integer (n ≥ 1).

Do not include any test cases or example usage.\\nThe code should handle the input format shown in the example usage.\\n\\nInput:\\nProblem:Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.\\n\\nFunction name should be: newman_prime\\nExample usage: newman_prime(3)\\n\\nDiscussion:\\nSystem say to All: Summary of key points and decisions:\\n\\n- Definition agreed:\\n  - Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) sequence: S(0)=1, S(1)=1, S(n)=2*S(n−1)+S(n−2).\\n  - NSW primes for this task are S(p) where p is an odd prime index (p ∈ {3,5,7,11,...}) and S(p) itself is prime. S(2)=3 is explicitly excluded.\\n  - This matches the example: newman_prime(3) = 239. The first four NSW primes: 7 (S3), 41 (S5), 239 (S7), 8119 (S11). Note: S(13)=47321 is composite (79×599), so it must not be counted.\\n\\n- Implementation approach:\\n  - Iteratively generate the NSW sequence using the recurrence with rolling state (keep S(n−2), S(n−1)); avoid recomputation.\\n  - Check only prime indices p (odd primes ≥ 3). Use a simple exact primality test for the index (trial division up to sqrt(p) is sufficient).\\n  - For S(p) primality:\\n    - Quick small-prime trial division (e.g., primes up to 1000) as a fast filter.\\n    - Miller–Rabin strong probable-prime test:\\n      - Deterministic for 64-bit integers using known bases (either [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] or [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]).\\n      - For larger integers, this becomes probabilistic; acceptable for typical constraints, or consider Baillie–PSW if stricter determinism is required.\\n\\n- Input validation:\\n  - n must be a positive integer (n ≥ 1). Raise an error on invalid input. Most proposals use ValueError; one proposal suggests TypeError for non-int.\\n\\n- Output expectations/tests:\\n  - newman_prime(1) == 7\\n  - newman_prime(2) == 41\\n  - newman_prime(3) == 239\\n  -

Python’s big integers handle growth of S(n), but performance will be dominated by primality checks for larger n.\\n\\n- Optional enhancements mentioned:\\n  - Stream/generator of NSW primes.\\n  - Cache across calls.\\n  -

Do not include any test cases or example usage.\\nThe code should handle the input format shown in the example usage.\\n\\nInput:\\nProblem:Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.\\n\\nFunction name should be: newman_prime\\nExample usage: newman_prime(3)\\n\\nDiscussion:\\nSystem say to All: Summary of key points and decisions:\\n\\n- Definition agreed:\\n  - Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) sequence: S(0)=1, S(1)=1, S(n)=2*S(n−1)+S(n−2).\\n  - NSW primes for this task are S(p) where p is an odd prime index (p ∈ {3,5,7,11,...}) and S(p) itself is prime. S(2)=3 is explicitly excluded.\\n  - This matches the example: newman_prime(3) = 239. The first four NSW primes: 7 (S3), 41 (S5), 239 (S7), 8119 (S11). Note: S(13)=47321 is composite (79×599), so it must not be counted.\\n\\n- Implementation approach:\\n  - Iteratively generate the NSW sequence using the recurrence with rolling state (keep S(n−2), S(n−1)); avoid recomputation.\\n  - Check only prime indices p (odd primes ≥ 3). Use a simple exact primality test for the index (trial division up to sqrt(p) is sufficient).\\n  - For S(p) primality:\\n    - Quick small-prime trial division (e.g., primes up to 1000) as a fast filter.\\n    - Miller–Rabin strong probable-prime test:\\n      - Deterministic for 64-bit integers using known bases (either [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] or [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]).\\n      - For larger integers, this becomes probabilistic; acceptable for typical constraints, or consider Baillie–PSW if stricter determinism is required.\\n\\n- Input validation:\\n  - n must be a positive integer (n ≥ 1). Raise an error on invalid input. Most proposals use ValueError; one proposal suggests TypeError for non-int.\\n\\n- Output expectations/tests:\\n  - newman_prime(1) == 7\\n  - newman_prime(2) == 41\\n  - newman_prime(3) == 239\\n  -

S(2)=3 is explicitly excluded.\\n  - This matches the example: newman_prime(3) = 239. The first four NSW primes: 7 (S3), 41 (S5), 239 (S7), 8119 (S11). Note: S(13)=47321 is composite (79×599), so it must not be counted.\\n\\n- Implementation approach:\\n  - Iteratively generate the NSW sequence using the recurrence with rolling state (keep S(n−2), S(n−1)); avoid recomputation.\\n  - Check only prime indices p (odd primes ≥ 3). Use a simple exact primality test for the index (trial division up to sqrt(p) is sufficient).\\n  - For S(p) primality:\\n    - Quick small-prime trial division (e.g., primes up to 1000) as a fast filter.\\n    - Miller–Rabin strong probable-prime test:\\n      - Deterministic for 64-bit integers using known bases (either [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] or [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]).\\n      - For larger integers, this becomes probabilistic; acceptable for typical constraints, or consider Baillie–PSW if stricter determinism is required.\\n\\n- Input validation:\\n  - n must be a positive integer (n ≥ 1). Raise an error on invalid input. Most proposals use ValueError; one proposal suggests TypeError for non-int.\\n\\n- Output expectations/tests:\\n  - newman_prime(1) == 7\\n  - newman_prime(2) == 41\\n  - newman_prime(3) == 239\\n  -

S(2)=3 is explicitly excluded.\\n  - This matches the example: newman_prime(3) = 239. The first four NSW primes: 7 (S3), 41 (S5), 239 (S7), 8119 (S11). Note: S(13)=47321 is composite (79×599), so it must not be counted.\\n\\n- Implementation approach:\\n  - Iteratively generate the NSW sequence using the recurrence with rolling state (keep S(n−2), S(n−1)); avoid recomputation.\\n  - Check only prime indices p (odd primes ≥ 3). Use a simple exact primality test for the index (trial division up to sqrt(p) is sufficient).\\n  - For S(p) primality:\\n    - Quick small-prime trial division (e.g., primes up to 1000) as a fast filter.\\n    - Miller–Rabin strong probable-prime test:\\n      - Deterministic for 64-bit integers using known bases (either [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] or [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]).\\n      - For larger integers, this becomes probabilistic; acceptable for typical constraints, or consider Baillie–PSW if stricter determinism is required.\\n\\n- Input validation:\\n  - n must be a positive integer (n ≥ 1).

S(2)=3 is explicitly excluded.\\n  - This matches the example: newman_prime(3) = 239. The first four NSW primes: 7 (S3), 41 (S5), 239 (S7), 8119 (S11). Note: S(13)=47321 is composite (79×599), so it must not be counted.\\n\\n- Implementation approach:\\n  - Iteratively generate the NSW sequence using the recurrence with rolling state (keep S(n−2), S(n−1)); avoid recomputation.\\n  - Check only prime indices p (odd primes ≥ 3). Use a simple exact primality test for the index (trial division up to sqrt(p) is sufficient).\\n  - For S(p) primality:\\n    - Quick small-prime trial division (e.g., primes up to 1000) as a fast filter.\\n    - Miller–Rabin strong probable-prime test:\\n      - Deterministic for 64-bit integers using known bases (either [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] or [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]).\\n      - For larger integers, this becomes probabilistic; acceptable for typical constraints, or consider Baillie–PSW if stricter determinism is required.\\n\\n- Input validation:\\n  - n must be a positive integer (n ≥ 1).

S(2)=3 is explicitly excluded.\\n  - This matches the example: newman_prime(3) = 239. The first four NSW primes: 7 (S3), 41 (S5), 239 (S7), 8119 (S11). Note: S(13)=47321 is composite (79×599), so it must not be counted.\\n\\n- Implementation approach:\\n  - Iteratively generate the NSW sequence using the recurrence with rolling state (keep S(n−2), S(n−1)); avoid recomputation.\\n  - Check only prime indices p (odd primes ≥ 3). Use a simple exact primality test for the index (trial division up to sqrt(p) is sufficient).\\n  - For S(p) primality:\\n    - Quick small-prime trial division (e.g., primes up to 1000) as a fast filter.\\n    - Miller–Rabin strong probable-prime test:\\n      - Deterministic for 64-bit integers using known bases (either [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] or [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]).\\n      - For larger integers, this becomes probabilistic; acceptable for typical constraints, or consider Baillie–PSW if stricter determinism is required.\\n\\n- Input validation:\\n  - n must be a positive integer (n ≥ 1). Raise an error on invalid input. Most proposals use ValueError; one proposal suggests TypeError for non-int.\\n\\n- Output expectations/tests:\\n  - newman_prime(1) == 7\\n  - newman_prime(2) == 41\\n  - newman_prime(3) == 239\\n  -

Parameter to optionally include S(2)=3 (default excluded), though not needed for this task.\\n\\nYour output should follow this format:\\n```python\\n[python code]\\n```\\n\\nYour output:\", \"model_response\": {\"message\": \"```python\\ndef newman_prime(n):\\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"n must be a positive integer\\\")\\n\\n    def _gen_small_primes(limit=1000):\\n        sieve = bytearray(b\\\"\\\\x01\\\") * (limit + 1)\\n        sieve[0:2] = b\\\"\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\"\\n        for p in range(2, int(limit ** 0.5) + 1):\\n            if sieve[p]:\\n                step = p\\n                start = p * p\\n                sieve[start:limit + 1:step] = b\\\"\\\\x00\\\" * ((limit -

S(2)=3 is explicitly excluded.\\n  - This matches the example: newman_prime(3) = 239. The first four NSW primes: 7 (S3), 41 (S5), 239 (S7), 8119 (S11). Note: S(13)=47321 is composite (79×599), so it must not be counted.\\n\\n- Implementation approach:\\n  - Iteratively generate the NSW sequence using the recurrence with rolling state (keep S(n−2), S(n−1)); avoid recomputation.\\n  - Check only prime indices p (odd primes ≥ 3). Use a simple exact primality test for the index (trial division up to sqrt(p) is sufficient).\\n  - For S(p) primality:\\n    - Quick small-prime trial division (e.g., primes up to 1000) as a fast filter.\\n    - Miller–Rabin strong probable-prime test:\\n      - Deterministic for 64-bit integers using known bases (either [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] or [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]).\\n      - For larger integers, this becomes probabilistic; acceptable for typical constraints, or consider Baillie–PSW if stricter determinism is required.\\n\\n- Input validation:\\n  - n must be a positive integer (n ≥ 1). Raise an error on invalid input. Most proposals use ValueError; one proposal suggests TypeError for non-int.\\n\\n- Output expectations/tests:\\n  - newman_prime(1) == 7\\n  - newman_prime(2) == 41\\n  - newman_prime(3) == 239\\n  - newman_prime(4) == 8119\\n  - Example usage: newman_prime(3) -> 239\\n\\n- Practical/portability notes:\\n  - Keep source ASCII-only; previous code samples failed to compile due to Unicode en dashes (U+2013) in comments/docstrings.\\n  - Python’s big integers handle growth of S(n), but performance will be dominated by primality checks for larger n.\\n\\n- Optional enhancements mentioned:\\n  - Stream/generator of NSW primes.\\n  - Cache across calls.\\n  - Parameter to optionally include S(2)=3 (default excluded), though not needed for this task.\\n\\nYour output should follow this format:\\n```python\\n[python code]\\n```\\n\\nYour output:\", \"model_response\": {\"message\": \"```python\\ndef newman_prime(n):\\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 0:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"n must be a positive integer\\\")\\n\\n    def primes_upto(limit):\\n        sieve = bytearray(b\\\"\\\\x01\\\") * (limit + 1)\\n        if limit >= 0:\\n            sieve[0] = 0\\n        if limit >= 1:\\n            sieve[1] = 0\\n        p = 2\\n        while p * p <= limit:\\n            if sieve[p]:\\n                step = p\\n                start = p * p\\n                sieve[start:limit + 1:step] = b\\\"\\\\x00\\\" * (((limit -

Do not include any test cases or example usage.\\nThe code should handle the input format shown in the example usage.\\n\\nInput:\\nProblem:Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.\\n\\nFunction name should be: newman_prime\\nExample usage: newman_prime(3)\\n\\nDiscussion:\\nSystem say to All: Summary of key points and decisions:\\n\\n- Definition agreed:\\n  - Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) sequence: S(0)=1, S(1)=1, S(n)=2*S(n−1)+S(n−2).\\n  - NSW primes for this task are S(p) where p is an odd prime index (p ∈ {3,5,7,11,...}) and S(p) itself is prime. S(2)=3 is explicitly excluded.\\n  - This matches the example: newman_prime(3) = 239. The first four NSW primes: 7 (S3), 41 (S5), 239 (S7), 8119 (S11). Note: S(13)=47321 is composite (79×599), so it must not be counted.\\n\\n- Implementation approach:\\n  - Iteratively generate the NSW sequence using the recurrence with rolling state (keep S(n−2), S(n−1)); avoid recomputation.\\n  - Check only prime indices p (odd primes ≥ 3). Use a simple exact primality test for the index (trial division up to sqrt(p) is sufficient).\\n  - For S(p) primality:\\n    - Quick small-prime trial division (e.g., primes up to 1000) as a fast filter.\\n    - Miller–Rabin strong probable-prime test:\\n      - Deterministic for 64-bit integers using known bases (either [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] or [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]).\\n      - For larger integers, this becomes probabilistic; acceptable for typical constraints, or consider Baillie–PSW if stricter determinism is required.\\n\\n- Input validation:\\n  - n must be a positive integer (n ≥ 1). Raise an error on invalid input. Most proposals use ValueError; one proposal suggests TypeError for non-int.\\n\\n- Output expectations/tests:\\n  - newman_prime(1) == 7\\n  - newman_prime(2) == 41\\n  - newman_prime(3) == 239\\n  - newman_prime(4) == 8119\\n  - Example usage: newman_prime(3) -> 239\\n\\n- Practical/portability notes:\\n  - Keep source ASCII-only; previous code samples failed to compile due to Unicode en dashes (U+2013) in comments/docstrings.\\n  - Python’s big integers handle growth of S(n), but performance will be dominated by primality checks for larger n.\\n\\n- Optional enhancements mentioned:\\n  - Stream/generator of NSW primes.\\n  - Cache across calls.\\n  - Parameter to optionally include S(2)=3 (default excluded), though not needed for this task.\\n\\nYour output should follow this format:\\n```python\\n[python code]\\n```\\n\\nYour output:\", \"model_response\": {\"message\": \"```python\\ndef newman_prime(n):\\n    if not isinstance(n, int):\\n        raise TypeError(\\\"n must be an integer\\\")\\n    if n < 1:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"n must be >= 1\\\")\\n\\n    def is_prime_index(k):\\n        if k < 2:\\n            return False\\n        if k % 2 == 0:\\n            return k == 2\\n        r = int(k**0.5)\\n        i = 3\\n        while i <= r:\\n            if k % i == 0:\\n                return False\\n            i += 2\\n        return True\\n\\n    def small_primes(limit=1000):\\n        sieve = bytearray(b\\\"\\\\x01\\\") * (limit + 1)\\n        sieve[:2] = b\\\"\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\"\\n        for p in range(2, int(limit**0.5) + 1):\\n            if sieve[p]:\\n                start = p * p\\n                step = p\\n                sieve[start : limit + 1 : step] = b\\\"\\\\x00\\\" * ((limit -
