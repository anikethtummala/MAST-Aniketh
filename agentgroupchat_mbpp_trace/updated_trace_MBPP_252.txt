C0002 say to All: ### Implementation Discussion:
- Implement a Python function merge_dict that returns a new dictionary containing keys from both inputs.
- On key conflicts, values from the second dictionary should overwrite those from the first (common and intuitive behavior).
- Use copy + update for broad compatibility across Python versions.
- Include basic type checking to provide clear errors for non-dict inputs.
- Provide example usages matching the prompt.

### Code Solution:
def merge_dict(d1, d2):
    """
    Merge two dictionaries into a new dictionary.

    On key conflicts, values from d2 overwrite values from d1.

    Args:
        d1 (dict): The first dictionary.
        d2 (dict): The second dictionary.

    Returns:
        dict: A new dictionary containing all key-value pairs from d1 and d2.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If either d1 or d2 is not a dictionary.

    return merged


# Example usages:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(merge_dict({'a': 100, 'b': 200}, {'x': 300, 'y': 200}))
    # Output: {'a': 100, 'b': 200, 'x': 300, 'y': 200}

C0003 say to All: ### Critical Analysis:
- The requirement is minimal: implement merge_dict(d1, d2) to merge two dictionaries; the example implies the second dictionary should overwrite values on key conflicts.
- Common pitfalls to watch:
  - Mutating an input (e.g., using d1.update(d2) and returning d1) can introduce side effects and make callers’ data change unexpectedly.
  - Using Python 3.9+ union operator (d1 | d2) without noting version constraints can break on older interpreters.
  - Mixing prose and code in the same cell/file can lead to “invalid syntax” errors even when the function itself is correct.
  - Lack of input validation may lead to cryptic errors if non-dict arguments are passed.
- Tests/examples should confirm: overwrite behavior, immutability of inputs, handling of empty dicts, and type errors for invalid inputs.

### Improvement Suggestions:
- Return a new dictionary and do not mutate inputs.
- Validate that both arguments are dict instances; raise a clear TypeError otherwise.
- Keep implementation compatible across Python versions (avoid relying solely on the union operator).
- Provide concise doctests and simple assertions demonstrating behavior and guarding against regressions.

Proposed robust implementation (code-only, minimal, version-agnostic):

def merge_dict(d1, d2):
    """
    Merge two dictionaries into a new dictionary.

    - On key conflicts, values from d2 overwrite values from d1.
    - Inputs are not mutated.

    Examples:
    >>> merge_dict({'a': 100, 'b': 200}, {'x': 300, 'y': 200})
    {'a': 100, 'b': 200, 'x': 300, 'y': 200}
    >>> merge_dict({'a': 1}, {'a': 2, 'b': 3})
    {'a': 2, 'b': 3}
    >>> d1 = {'k': 1}; d2 = {'m': 2}
    >>> out = merge_dict(d1, d2)
    >>> out == {'k': 1, 'm': 2} and d1 == {'k': 1} and d2 == {'m': 2}
    True
    """
    if not isinstance(d1, dict) or not isinstance(d2, dict):
        raise TypeError("merge_dict expects two dict objects")
    result = dict(d1)
    result.update(d2)
    return result

Optional alternatives and notes:
- Python 3.9+: return d1 | d2 achieves the same, but document the version requirement.
- If a deep/recursive merge is desired for nested dictionaries, clarify the spec; current implementation performs a shallow merge by design.

C0002 say to All: ### Implementation Discussion:
- The function returns a new dictionary that contains the items of the first dictionary, updated with items from the second dictionary.
- On key conflicts, values from the second dictionary take precedence.
- Inputs are not mutated (uses copy and update).
- Type validation ensures both inputs are dictionaries; otherwise, a TypeError is raised.
- Implementation uses copy() and update() for broad Python 3 compatibility.

C0003 say to All: ### Critical Analysis:
- Requirements are underspecified on key-conflict behavior. Typical expectation is that the second dictionary’s values overwrite the first’s on duplicate keys; this should be stated explicitly.
- Mutation semantics are not stated. For safety and predictability, the function should not mutate the input dictionaries.
- Input validation is unspecified. Without type checks, passing non-dict arguments could lead to confusing errors.
- Python version considerations are not addressed. The dict union operator (|) requires Python 3.9+, while {**d1, **d2} works in 3.5+. Using copy()+update() is the most broadly compatible and readable.
- Depth of merge is not defined. Assuming a shallow merge is standard; deep/recursive merging would need additional guidance.
- Return type consistency is not documented. It should return a new dict.
- Edge cases not mentioned:
  - Empty dictionaries
  - Overlapping keys
  - Very large dictionaries
  - Same object passed twice
- No notes on ordering semantics. In Python 3.7+, dicts preserve insertion order; update semantics will keep d1’s order with d2’s keys appended, while overwritten keys will carry d2’s values.
- Testing and examples: Only a single example is provided; unit tests for edge cases would improve confidence.

### Improvement Suggestions:
- Clarify and document:
  - Behavior on key conflicts: d2 overwrites d1.
  - Shallow merge only.
  - Inputs are not mutated.
  - Explicitly raise TypeError when either argument is not a dict.
  - Return a new dict.
  - State supported Python versions or choose an implementation compatible with 3.5+.
- Implement with clear, robust semantics:
  - Prefer d1.copy(); result.update(d2) for clarity and broad compatibility.
  - Include a concise docstring and type hints.
- Provide a minimal, correct reference implementation:
  def merge_dict(d1, d2):
      """
      Merge two dictionaries into a new dictionary.
      - Shallow merge: for duplicate keys, values from d2 overwrite d1.
      - Does not mutate the input dictionaries.
      Raises:
          TypeError: if either argument is not a dict.
      """
      if not isinstance(d1, dict) or not isinstance(d2, dict):
          raise TypeError("merge_dict expects two dict objects")
      result = d1.copy()
      result.update(d2)
      return result
- Add basic tests/examples to validate behavior:
  - merge_dict({'a': 1}, {'b': 2}) -> {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
  - merge_dict({'a': 1}, {'a': 2}) -> {'a': 2}
  - merge_dict({}, {}) -> {}
  - Ensure original inputs remain unchanged.
- Consider documenting alternatives for read-only views:
  - collections.ChainMap(d2, d1) provides a dynamic merged view but does not return a standalone dict and reflects mutations in inputs; not a drop-in replacement, but worth mentioning in docs if relevant.

C0002 say to All: ### Implementation Discussion:
- Implement merge_dict(d1, d2) to return a new dictionary that merges d1 and d2.
- Validate both inputs are dict instances; otherwise raise TypeError with the exact message: "merge_dict expects two dict objects".
- Use d1.copy() followed by result.update(d2) to avoid mutating inputs and to ensure d2 values overwrite on key conflicts.
- This approach is shallow, broadly compatible across Python 3 versions, and avoids the dict union operator.

C0003 say to All: ### Critical Analysis:
- Requirements clarity: It appears the expected behavior is a shallow merge where keys in the second dict overwrite those in the first, inputs must not be mutated, and input validation should raise TypeError with a clear message if either argument is not a dict.
- Potential pitfalls:
  - Mutating inputs: Using d1.update(d2) directly would violate the no-mutation requirement.
  - Version-specific operators: The dict union operator (|) requires Python 3.9+, which may not be guaranteed; avoid relying on it unless confirmed.
  - Input validation: Using too-broad checks (e.g., duck-typing or accepting Mappings) may deviate from the strict “dict objects” requirement. Conversely, rejecting dict subclasses might be unnecessarily strict; isinstance(..., dict) will accept subclasses and is appropriate.
  - Merge depth ambiguity: Nested dicts should not be deep-merged; clarify that only a shallow merge is performed to prevent misinterpretation.
  - Error message consistency: Ensure the TypeError message is exactly as specified to prevent brittle tests from failing.
- Order preservation: In modern Python, dicts preserve insertion order. The chosen merge method should preserve order deterministically (d1 keys first, then d2, with d2 overwriting duplicates and taking the later position).

### Improvement Suggestions:
- Implementation strategy:
  - Do not mutate inputs; use a copy-then-update approach:
    - result = d1.copy(); result.update(d2)
  - Validate inputs strictly as dicts:
    - if not isinstance(d1, dict) or not isinstance(d2, dict): raise TypeError("merge_dict expects two dict objects")
  - Keep it shallow and document overwrite semantics and non-mutation clearly in a short docstring.
- Compatibility considerations:
  - Avoid using the dict union operator (|) to maintain compatibility with Python versions earlier than 3.9.
  - Using {**d1, **d2} is fine in Python 3.5+, but copy+update is clearer and equally efficient.
- API and documentation:
  - Include type hints for readability: def merge_dict(d1: dict, d2: dict) -> dict
  - Docstring should specify:
    - Shallow merge
    - d2 overwrites on key conflicts
    - Inputs are not mutated
    - TypeError is raised for non-dict inputs
- Testing suggestions:
  - Basic merge with disjoint keys
  - Overlapping keys where d2 overwrites d1
  - Empty dict with non-empty dict (both orders)
  - Input immutability check (original dicts unchanged after call)
  - Type validation: passing non-dict types raises TypeError with the exact message
- Optional extension (only if requirements allow):
  - Accept Mapping instead of dict for broader utility (collections.abc.Mapping), but this deviates from “dict objects” strictness; confirm with C0001 before adopting.
