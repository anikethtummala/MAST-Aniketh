C0002 say to All: ### Implementation Discussion:
- Definition used: The Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) sequence is S(0)=1, S(1)=1, S(n)=2*S(n−1)+S(n−2). In many programming challenges, a “Newman–Shanks–Williams prime” refers to a prime term among the odd-indexed sequence values: S(3), S(5), S(7), … The first few such primes are 7, 41, 239, 1393, 8119, …
- Function behavior: newman_prime(n) returns the nth prime among the odd-indexed terms of S(n). For example, newman_prime(3) = 239.
- Approach:
  - Generate S(n) iteratively using the recurrence; check only odd indices for primality.
  - Use a fast deterministic Miller–Rabin test for 64-bit range (bases: 2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022). For larger integers the same test becomes probabilistic but is reliable for typical kata constraints.

C0003 say to All: ### Critical Analysis:
- Definition ambiguity: There are multiple conventions in the literature/katas. Some define NSW primes as primes among the Newman–Shanks–Williams numbers S(n) with n prime (which would include n=2 giving S(2)=3), while many practical lists start from S(3)=7 and exclude S(2)=3. The example newman_prime(3) strongly suggests 7, 41, 239 as the first three; thus S(2)=3 is likely excluded. This must be explicitly documented and enforced in code to avoid off-by-one results.
- Index selection: NSW primes should be taken at prime indices (n prime), not merely “odd indices”. Checking only odd indices will both wrongly include composite-index terms and potentially exclude the n=2 case if that definition is desired. Conversely, only checking prime indices matches the standard definition.
- Value primality testing: Using a Miller–Rabin implementation with bases tuned “for 64-bit determinism” is insufficient for Python big integers, since S(n) grows quickly beyond 2^64. That can lead to false positives on larger terms. Without constraints, a deterministic approach (e.g., Baillie–PSW) or a robust MR base set for larger ranges is needed.
- Performance considerations:
  - Iteratively building S(n) with a simple recurrence is appropriate; jumping directly to S(p) via closed forms is overkill and introduces floating-point/irrational issues. However, it’s important to keep it efficient and avoid recomputation.
  - Early trial division against a small primes wheel can quickly eliminate many composites (e.g., S(15) divisible by 7).
  - Index primality testing should be cheap; a simple deterministic check up to sqrt(i) or a small sieve is fine, because indices are small compared to S(i).
- Integer sizes: Ensure big-integer support. Any fixed-width integer language implementation will overflow quickly. This must be called out or handled explicitly.
- Input validation: The function should validate that n is a positive integer and raise a clear error for invalid inputs.
- Encoding and style: Non-ASCII punctuation (en dash in “newman–shanks–williams”) can cause parse errors in some environments. Keep source ASCII-only.
- Testing: Without explicit expected outputs, it’s easy to drift. Known initial NSW primes (excluding S(2)) should be used for unit tests: 7 (S3), 41 (S5), 239 (S7), 8119 (S11), 47321 (S13), … Note that S(9)=1393 is composite (7*199) and must not be counted; S(8)=577 is prime but index 8 is not prime, so it must be excluded.

### Improvement Suggestions:
- Clarify and document the exact definition used:
  - State that NSW primes are S(p) with p prime and that we exclude p=2 (so the sequence starts at 7).
  - Alternatively, expose a parameter include_s2=False to toggle inclusion of S(2)=3, and document it clearly. Keep defaults aligned with the example where newman_prime(3) should return 239.
- Algorithmic approach:
  - Generate the NSW sequence iteratively: S0=1, S1=1, then S(n)=2*S(n-1)+S(n-2) for n>=2.
  - Iterate index i starting from 2; maintain S(i-2), S(i-1). For each i:
    - If i is prime (and i >= 3 per chosen definition), test S(i) for primality; if prime, increment count; return when count==n.
  - This ensures O(N) sequence steps where N is the highest index checked, and avoids recomputing S(k).
- Index primality:
  - Because indices remain relatively small, a simple deterministic check (trial division up to sqrt(i)) or a small incremental prime sieve is sufficient and fast.
- Value primality:
  - Do a quick small-prime trial division (e.g., primes up to 1000) to eliminate obvious composites cheaply.
  - Use a robust primality test:
    - Prefer Baillie–PSW (Miller–Rabin base 2 + strong Lucas test) for a practical deterministic solution over large ranges.
    - If implementing MR only, use multiple bases. For n < 2^64, bases [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] are deterministic; for larger n, include more bases or clearly document probabilistic nature. Alternatively, if allowed, use a library primality test (e.g., sympy.isprime).
- Correctness checks:
  - Add unit tests:
    - newman_prime(1) == 7
    - newman_prime(2) == 41
    - newman_prime(3) == 239
    - newman_prime(4) == 8119
    - newman_prime(5) == 47321
  - Negative/zero input raises ValueError/TypeError.
- Practical safeguards:
  - Keep the source ASCII-only to avoid the en dash parsing issue.
  - Document time/space complexity and note that large n may become expensive due to big-integer arithmetic, with guidance on reasonable ranges.
- Optional enhancements:
  - Provide a generator version that yields successive NSW primes, enabling streaming use.
  - Cache last S(i-1), S(i) and last index across calls (if a stateful module-level cache is acceptable) to amortize cost over multiple calls.

C0001 say to All: ### Requirement Analysis:
- Goal: Implement a function newman_prime(n) that returns the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) prime number.
- NSW sequence definition:
  - S(0) = 1, S(1) = 1
  - S(n) = 2*S(n−1) + S(n−2) for n ≥ 2
- NSW primes: terms S(p) where the index p is an odd prime (3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...). This excludes S(2) = 3, aligning with the example expectation.
- Expected mapping:
  - n = 1 -> 7  (S(3))
  - n = 2 -> 41 (S(5))
  - n = 3 -> 239 (S(7))
  - n = 4 -> 8119 (S(11))
  - n = 5 -> 47321 (S(13))
- Input validation:
  - n must be a positive integer (n >= 1). Raise ValueError for invalid inputs.
- Environment/Language: Python 3 (standard library only).
- Example usage: newman_prime(3) -> 239
- Output: Python int (arbitrary precision).

### Technical Specifications:
- Function signature:
  - def newman_prime(n: int) -> int
- Behavior:
  - Validate n as a positive int; else raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer").
  - Iterate over odd prime indices p = 3, 5, 7, 11, ...:
    - Compute S(p) using the NSW recurrence incrementally from the last computed index to avoid recomputation.
    - Test S(p) for primality.
    - Count only those S(p) that are prime; when count == n, return S(p).
- NSW number generation:
  - Maintain rolling state:
    - idx = 1, s_nm2 = 1 (S(0)), s_nm1 = 1 (S(1))
    - To advance to S(k) for k > idx:
      - For each step: s = 2*s_nm1 + s_nm2; update s_nm2, s_nm1; idx += 1
  - Extend until idx == p to obtain S(p).
- Prime index generation:
  - Iterate k from 3 upwards by 2 and test for primality (is_prime(k)).
- Primality testing (shared for index and S(p)):
  - Fast path: trial division by small primes (e.g., first ~1000 primes or all primes up to 1000) to quickly reject obvious composites.
  - For remaining candidates:
    - If n < 2^64, use deterministic Miller–Rabin with known 64-bit witness set:
      - Witnesses: [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022] (deterministic for 64-bit range).
    - If n ≥ 2^64, use Miller–Rabin with a strong probable-prime set of bases for high confidence:
      - Bases: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37]
    - Implement standard strong probable prime (SPRP) check:
      - Write n−1 = d * 2^r with d odd.
      - For each base a:
        - x = pow(a, d, n)
        - If x == 1 or x == n−1, continue to next base.
        - Repeat r−1 times: x = (x*x) % n; if x == n−1, break; else continue.
        - If loop ends without break, composite.
  - Handle small edge cases: n < 2 not prime; explicitly allow small primes.
- Complexity:
  - NSW generation up to index p is O(p).
  - Primality testing:
    - Trial division by small primes up to 1000 is O(#primes), negligible.
    - Miller–Rabin per base is O(log^3 n) via modular exponentiation; number of bases is small and fixed.
- Correctness constraints:
  - Count only S(p) where p is an odd prime (3, 5, 7, ...).
  - Do not include S(2) = 3 in the sequence of NSW primes.
- Edge cases:
  - n = 1 returns 7.
  - Large n will produce very large integers; Python's big ints handle arbitrary precision.
- Pseudocode:
  - if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 0: raise ValueError
  - init s_nm2 = 1, s_nm1 = 1, idx = 1
  - count = 0
  - for k from 3 to infinity step 2:
    - if is_prime(k):
      - while idx < k:
        - s = 2*s_nm1 + s_nm2
        - s_nm2, s_nm1 = s_nm1, s
        - idx += 1
      - candidate = s_nm1  # this is S(k)
      - if is_prime(candidate):
        - count += 1
        - if count == n: return candidate
- Testing/Acceptance:
  - newman_prime(1) == 7
  - newman_prime(2) == 41
  - newman_prime(3) == 239
  - newman_prime(4) == 8119
  - newman_prime(5) == 47321
  - Input validation tests: newman_prime(0), newman_prime(-1), newman_prime(2.5), newman_prime("3") -> ValueError
- Code quality:
  - Use type hints and docstrings.
  - No external dependencies.
  - Efficient and readable; avoid recomputing NSW values from scratch.
  - ASCII-only source.

C0003 say to All: ### Critical Analysis:
- Definition ambiguity: Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) primes are often defined as prime terms S(p) of the Newman–Shanks–Williams sequence S(n) = 2*S(n-1) + S(n-2), S(0)=1, S(1)=1, where the index p is a prime number. The provided example newman_prime(3) = 239 implies the function should count only odd prime indices (p ∈ {3,5,7,...}), excluding p=2 (since S(2)=3 would otherwise make the 3rd result 41, not 239). We must lock onto this interpretation to avoid mismatched outputs.
- Common pitfall: Implementations that return the nth prime term of S(n) for all n (without requiring prime index) will incorrectly include S(4)=17, contradicting the example. Another frequent mistake is to iterate only odd indices instead of prime indices, which also yields wrong answers.
- Efficiency concerns: 
  - Recomputing S(n) from scratch for each prime index p is wasteful; the sequence should be built iteratively once, reusing the last two values.
  - Floating-point closed-form approximations will introduce errors; use integer recurrence only.
  - Primality testing must be robust. S(p) grows exponentially; for modest n it fits in 64-bit, but can quickly exceed it. Relying solely on trial division will not scale. Conversely, an unbounded deterministic Miller–Rabin base set may be overkill or misused.
- Input handling: Lack of validation for n (non-integer, <=0) would lead to unclear failures or incorrect results.
- Portability/readability: Avoid Unicode dashes or special characters; ensure ASCII-only identifiers and docstrings. Name must be exactly newman_prime.
- Testing: Without clear unit tests aligned to the agreed definition (odd prime indices only), off-by-one errors are likely.

### Improvement Suggestions:
- Specification alignment:
  - Define NSW primes here as prime S(p) where p is an odd prime index (3, 5, 7, ...), explicitly excluding p=2 to match the example: newman_prime(1)=7, newman_prime(2)=41, newman_prime(3)=239, newman_prime(4)=8119.
  - Document this in the function docstring to avoid confusion with broader definitions.
- Algorithm outline:
  - Validate input: n must be an int >= 1; raise ValueError otherwise.
  - Generate prime indices p:
    - Stream odd primes starting from 3 using a simple incremental primality test (trial division up to sqrt(p) is fine since p stays small).
  - Compute S(n) iteratively once:
    - Maintain current index i and last two terms (s_prev2, s_prev1) for S(i-2), S(i-1).
    - For each next target prime index p, advance i -> p updating S via s = 2*s_prev1 + s_prev2.
  - Test primality of S(p):
    - Quick filters: handle 2, small primes divisibility (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29), and small perfect squares if desired.
    - Miller–Rabin:
      - Use deterministic bases for 64-bit integers: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] suffices for n < 2^64.
      - For larger integers, either:
        - Accept probabilistic MR with a broader base set (e.g., [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]), or
        - Note that the function’s practical range is limited and document the probabilistic nature beyond 64-bit.
  - Count NSW primes found at odd prime indices until reaching the requested nth; return S(p) for the nth match.
- Correctness checkpoints:
  - Hardcode a few expected results for tests:
    - newman_prime(1) == 7
    - newman_prime(2) == 41
    - newman_prime(3) == 239
    - newman_prime(4) == 8119
  - Verify that S(13)=47321 is skipped (it equals 79*599, composite).
- Implementation quality:
  - Use only ASCII characters in code and docstrings.
  - Avoid recursion; iterative loop with O(1) state is sufficient.
  - Avoid recomputing S from 0 for each prime index; keep the ongoing state across indices.
  - Keep function name exactly newman_prime and provide a concise docstring explaining the odd prime index criterion and example usage.
- Optional enhancements:
  - Expose an optional parameter to include p=2 if future requirements change (default False to match current example).
  - Cache computed S(n) values if you anticipate multiple calls requesting increasing n, but since the function signature is simple, a single-run iterative approach is fine.
- Edge-case handling:
  - Very large n will produce extremely large S(p); document expected performance limits, as primality testing and big integer arithmetic will dominate runtime.

C0001 say to All: ### Requirement Analysis:
- Implement a function newman_prime(n) in Python that returns the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) prime number.
- The NSW sequence is defined by:
  - S(0) = 1, S(1) = 1
  - S(k) = 2*S(k-1) + S(k-2) for k ≥ 2
- NSW primes are those terms S(p) where p is an odd prime index and S(p) itself is prime. We explicitly exclude p = 2 (so S(2) = 3 is not counted).
- Example: newman_prime(3) should return 239 (sequence of NSW primes starts 7, 41, 239, 8119, ...).
- Input validation: n must be a positive integer (n ≥ 1). Otherwise, raise ValueError with a clear message.
- The function should be efficient and robust for reasonably large n; use a strong primality test for large NSW numbers.

### Technical Specifications:
- Language: Python 3
- Function signature: def newman_prime(n: int) -> int
- Input:
  - n: positive integer ≥ 1
- Output:
  - The nth NSW prime as a Python int (arbitrary precision)
- Definitions:
  - NSW sequence: S(0)=1, S(1)=1; S(k)=2*S(k-1)+S(k-2)
  - NSW prime: S(p) where p is an odd prime and S(p) is prime (exclude p=2)
- Algorithm:
  1. Validate input: if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1: raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer")
  2. Initialize:
     - s0, s1 = 1, 1  (S(0), S(1))
     - count = 0
  3. Iterate k from 2 upwards:
     - Compute s = 2*s1 + s0  (this is S(k))
     - If k is an odd prime index (check primality of k using a simple integer primality test suitable for small integers), then:
       - Test whether s is prime using a fast primality test:
         - First, trial divide by a small set of primes (e.g., all primes up to 1000) to quickly eliminate small factors.
         - If not eliminated, run Miller–Rabin primality test:
           - Deterministic for 64-bit inputs using bases [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37] or alternatively the 64-bit-deterministic set [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022].
           - For numbers larger than 2^64, run Miller–Rabin with a fixed set of bases (e.g., [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]) and optionally a few random bases to make error probability negligible (e.g., total of 8–12 rounds).
       - If s is prime: increment count; if count == n: return s
     - Shift window: s0, s1 = s1, s
  4. Continue until nth NSW prime is found.
- Helper functions:
  - is_small_prime(k: int) -> bool
    - Fast primality test for small k (the index), via trial division by odd integers up to sqrt(k); handle k < 2, k==2, even numbers.
  - is_prime(n: int) -> bool
    - If n < 2: return False
    - Check divisibility by small primes list (e.g., precomputed primes up to 1000)
    - If n <= 1: False; handle 2 and 3 as True; multiples of small primes as False
    - Miller–Rabin core with modular exponentiation (pow(a, d, n))
    - Deterministic path for n < 2^64 using the 7 special bases [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]
    - For n >= 2^64, run Miller–Rabin for bases [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19] and optionally a few randomized bases if desired; aim for at least 8 total rounds
- Performance considerations:
  - Maintain only two previous NSW terms; O(1) memory aside from integer sizes
  - The index primality checks are cheap since indices grow slowly relative to NSW values
  - Small-prime trial division significantly reduces Miller–Rabin invocations
- Edge cases:
  - n = 1 -> 7
  - n = 2 -> 41
  - n = 3 -> 239
  - n = 4 -> 8119
  - Non-integer or n < 1 -> raise ValueError
- Correctness notes:
  - We intentionally skip k = 2 even though S(2) = 3 is prime, to match the standard NSW prime definition using odd prime indices (and the provided example sequence).
- Complexity:
  - Time: dominated by primality testing of S(k); MR per test is O(log^3 S(k)) with modular exponentiation; the number of tests equals the count of odd prime indices checked until the nth NSW prime
  - Space: O(1) words for the sequence, plus negligible small constants
- Testing:
  - Unit tests:
    - assert newman_prime(1) == 7
    - assert newman_prime(2) == 41
    - assert newman_prime(3) == 239
    - assert newman_prime(4) == 8119
    - Verify ValueError on newman_prime(0), newman_prime(-5), newman_prime(1.5)
- Documentation:
  - Provide a docstring describing:
    - Definition of NSW sequence and NSW primes
    - Input constraints and error behavior
    - Example: newman_prime(3) -> 239

C0002 say to All: ### Implementation Discussion:
- Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) numbers are defined by S(0)=1, S(1)=1, and S(k)=2*S(k-1)+S(k-2).
- NSW primes are those S(p) where p is an odd prime index and S(p) itself is prime.
- The implementation iteratively generates S(k) and, when k is an odd prime (k ≥ 3), checks if S(k) is prime.
- Primality testing:
  - Quick elimination via trial division by small primes (up to 1000).
  - Miller–Rabin probabilistic primality test with a set of bases that is deterministic for 64-bit integers and highly reliable for larger values.
- The function validates input (n must be a positive integer) and returns the nth NSW prime. Example: newman_prime(3) -> 239 (sequence: 7, 41, 239, ...).

C0003 say to All: ### Critical Analysis:
- Definition clarity: Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) numbers are S(0)=1, S(1)=1, S(n)=2*S(n-1)+S(n-2). NSW primes are those S(p) where p is an odd prime index (p in {3,5,7,11,...}). A common mistake is checking S(n) for all odd n instead of only prime indices, which yields incorrect results.
- Example consistency: newman_prime(3) should return 239, which corresponds to the 3rd NSW prime S(7). The first four NSW primes are S(3)=7, S(5)=41, S(7)=239, S(11)=8119.
- Performance pitfalls:
  - Recomputing S(k) from scratch for each prime index is wasteful. Iterative buildup with rolling two-term state is optimal.
  - Naive primality testing (trial division to sqrt) on S(p) will be too slow as values grow exponentially (~(1+sqrt(2))^p).
- Primality testing:
  - Use a fast is_prime: small-prime trial division followed by Miller–Rabin. For 64-bit integers, there are known deterministic bases; for arbitrary-precision, a handful of bases provides negligible error probability.
  - Beware of using only small bases or only trial division; both can either be incorrect or too slow.
- Prime index generation:
  - Only odd primes are needed as indices. Generating primes via a simple incremental test is sufficient because indices grow slowly relative to the growth of S(p). A full sieve is optional but not necessary.
- Big integer handling:
  - S(n) grows very fast. Python’s big ints handle this; in other languages, a big integer library will be required.
- Validation and edge cases:
  - Ensure n is a positive integer; raise an informative error for invalid input.
  - Avoid Unicode punctuation (e.g., en-dashes) in code and docstrings to prevent parsing issues.

### Improvement Suggestions:
- Algorithm outline:
  - Validate n (must be int >= 1).
  - Implement is_probable_prime(n):
    - Handle n < 2 and small primes explicitly.
    - Trial divide by a small prime list (e.g., primes up to 1000 or reuse a generated small-primes list).
    - Miller–Rabin with a robust set of deterministic bases for 64-bit, and a larger fixed base set for larger ints (e.g., [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37]).
  - Implement a prime index generator yielding 3,5,7,11,...:
    - Start at 3; test odd candidates using a lightweight primality check (trial division against a dynamic list of small primes is enough for indices).
  - Compute S(k) iteratively up to each prime index p:
    - Maintain s0=1, s1=1 and a current index k=1.
    - To reach p, loop k+1..p: s0, s1 = s1, 2*s1 + s0.
    - Test S(p)=s1 for primality; count how many NSW primes found; return when reaching n.
- Reference Python implementation (ASCII-only):
  - Keep function name newman_prime.
  - Raise ValueError on invalid input.
  - Use Miller–Rabin with multiple bases and small-prime trial division.
- Correctness checks (examples to include in tests):
  - newman_prime(1) == 7
  - newman_prime(2) == 41
  - newman_prime(3) == 239
  - newman_prime(4) == 8119
- Practical notes:
  - Avoid recomputing S from 0 for each prime index; carry forward the recurrence state.
  - If desired, memoize S(k) for reuse across calls (optional; increases memory).
  - Document that for large n the function will be slow due to the size of S(p), not due to algorithmic inefficiency.
- Suggested code sketch (for C0002 to implement):

  - is_probable_prime(n): small-prime trial division; Miller–Rabin with bases [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37].
  - prime_index_generator(): yield 3,5,7,11,... using a simple incremental prime test for the index.
  - newman_prime(n):
    - validate n
    - s0, s1, k = 1, 1, 1
    - count = 0
    - for p in prime_index_generator():
      - while k < p: s0, s1 = s1, 2*s1 + s0; k += 1
      - if is_probable_prime(s1): count += 1; if count == n: return s1

This design is correct, efficient for reasonable n, avoids recomputation, and uses robust primality testing suitable for large NSW numbers.

C0001 say to All: ### Requirement Analysis:
- Objective: Provide a function that returns the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) prime number.
- Definitions:
  - NSW sequence S(n) is defined by:
    - S(0) = 1
    - S(1) = 1
    - S(n) = 2*S(n-1) + S(n-2) for n >= 2
  - NSW primes are values S(p) where p is an odd prime index (p = 3, 5, 7, 11, ...), and S(p) itself is prime. Index p = 2 (S(2)=3) is excluded.
- Function:
  - Name: newman_prime
  - Signature: newman_prime(n: int) -> int
  - Input: n (1-based position) — positive integer
  - Output: The nth NSW prime number as a Python int
  - Example: newman_prime(3) should return 239
- Input validation:
  - n must be an int and n >= 1
  - Raise TypeError if not int
  - Raise ValueError if n < 1
- Expected first outputs:
  - n=1 -> 7
  - n=2 -> 41
  - n=3 -> 239
  - n=4 -> 8119

### Technical Specifications:
- Language: Python 3.8+
- Public API:
  - def newman_prime(n: int) -> int
- Algorithm:
  - Iterate NSW sequence terms sequentially using recurrence:
    - Maintain rolling values s0 = 1 (S(0)), s1 = 1 (S(1))
    - For k from 2 upward:
      - s2 = 2*s1 + s0  # this is S(k)
      - Update s0, s1 = s1, s2
      - If k is a prime index and k is odd, test s2 for primality:
        - If prime, increment count; when count == n, return s2
  - Prime index detection (for k):
    - Implement a lightweight exact primality test suitable for relatively small k (trial division up to floor(sqrt(k)) with 2 and odd divisors)
  - Primality testing for S(k):
    - Use a combination of small-prime trial division and Miller–Rabin
    - Steps:
      1. Handle trivial cases (n <= 1, even, small primes)
      2. Trial divide by a small prime set (e.g., first primes up to 29: [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29])
      3. Miller–Rabin probabilistic test with bases [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
         - Deterministic for n < 3.4e14 and widely used for 64-bit; probabilistic (negligible error) for larger integers
         - Implement standard decomposition n-1 = d*2^s and the modular exponentiation checks
- Complexity considerations:
  - NSW growth is exponential; S(n) fits in Python big ints but grows fast
  - The dominant cost is primality testing of S(p); Miller–Rabin with a fixed small base set is efficient for practical n
  - Index primality checks are negligible compared to testing S(p)
- Error handling:
  - TypeError: if n is not int
  - ValueError: if n < 1
- Determinism and correctness:
  - The function must enumerate indices p over odd primes only (exclude p=2)
  - Return exactly the nth NSW prime as defined
- Testing:
  - Unit tests (examples):
    - assert newman_prime(1) == 7
    - assert newman_prime(2) == 41
    - assert newman_prime(3) == 239
    - assert newman_prime(4) == 8119
  - Input validation tests:
    - Expect ValueError for n=0, n=-5
    - Expect TypeError for n="3", n=3.0
- Implementation notes:
  - Use only standard library; do not rely on external packages
  - Keep code ASCII-only
  - Provide a docstring explaining NSW sequence and prime definition, clarifying that index must be an odd prime
  - Optional micro-optimizations:
    - Early exit on even S(k)
    - Cache small primes list globally for reuse
  - Example usage in docstring:
    - newman_prime(3) -> 239
